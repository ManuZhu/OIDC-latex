\title{{UPPRESSO}: An Unlinkable Privacy-PREserving Single Sign-On System}
\maketitle
\begin{abstract}
 The Single Sign-On (SSO) service, provided by identity provider (IdP),  is widely deployed and integrated to bring the convenience to both the relying party (RP) and the users.
 However, the privacy leakage is an obstacle to the users' adoption of SSO,
 as the curious IdP may track at which RPs users log in,
while collusive RPs could link the user from a common or related identifer(s) issued by the IdP.
 Existing solutions preserve the user's privacy  from either the curious IdP or the collusive RPs, but never from the both entities.
In this paper, we provide an SSO system, named UPRESSO, to hide the user's accessed RPs from the curious IdP
and prevent the identity linkage from the collusive RPs.
In UPRESSO, IdP generates a different privacy-preserving ID ($PID_U$) for a user among RPs, and binds $PID_U$ with a transformation of the RP identifier ($PID_{RP}$), without obtaining the real RP identifier.
Each RP uses a trapdoor to derive the user's unique account from $PID_U$,
while a user's accounts are different among the RPs.
UPRESSO  is compatible with OpenID Connect, a widely deployed and well analyzed SSO system;
    where dynamic registration is utilized to make $PID_{RP}$ valid in the IdP.
The analysis shows that user's privacy is preserved in UPRESSO without any degradation on the security of OpenID Connect.
We have implemented a prototype of UPRESSO. The evaluation demonstrates that UPRESSO is efficient, and only needs 208 ms for a user to login at an RP in our environment.
