\title{{UPPRESSO}: An Unlinkable Privacy-PREserving Single Sign-On System}
\maketitle
\begin{abstract}
Single sign-on (SSO) services
     are widely provided in the Internet by identity providers (IdPs) as the identity management
      and authentication infrastructure.
After being authenticated by the IdP,
    a user is allowed to sign onto all relying parties (RPs) trusting the IdP.
However,
    SSO introduces the potential leakage of user privacy,
        as (\emph{a}) a curious IdP could track a user's all visits to any RP
            and (\emph{b}) collusive RPs could link the user identity across different RPs,
            to learn the user's detailed activity profile.
%However, the privacy leakage is an obstacle to the users' adoption of SSO,
% as the curious IdP may track at which RPs users log in,
%while collusive RPs could link the user from a common or related identifer(s) issued by the IdP.
Existing privacy-preserving SSO solutions protect the users' activity profiles
    against either the curious IdP or the collusive RPs, but never prevent both of these threats.

In this paper, we propose an SSO system, called \emph{UPRESSO},
     to protect an user's activity profile of RP visits
        from both the curious IdP and the collusive RPs.


In UPRESSO, IdP generates a different privacy-preserving ID ($PID_U$) for a user among RPs, and binds $PID_U$ with a transformation of the RP identifier ($PID_{RP}$), without obtaining the real RP identifier.
Each RP uses a trapdoor to derive the user's unique account from $PID_U$,
while a user's accounts are different among the RPs.
UPRESSO  is compatible with OpenID Connect, a widely deployed and well analyzed SSO system;
    where dynamic registration is utilized to make $PID_{RP}$ valid in the IdP.
The analysis shows that user's privacy is preserved in UPRESSO without any degradation on the security of OpenID Connect.
We have implemented a prototype of UPRESSO. The evaluation demonstrates that UPRESSO is efficient, and only needs 208 ms for a user to login at an RP in our environment.
