\title{{UPPRESSO}: An Unlinkable Privacy-PREserving Single Sign-On System}
\maketitle
\begin{abstract}
As a widely adopted identity management and authentication mechanism in today's Internet, single sign-on (SSO)
%Single sign-on (SSO) services have been widely adopted in today's Internet to support identity management and authentication. SSO
allows a user to maintain only the credential for the identity provider (IdP), instead of one credential for each relying party (RP), which shifts the burden of user authentication from RPs to the IdP.
%After being authenticated by the identity provider (IdP), a user is allowed to log in to relying parties (RPs) by submitting an \emph{identity proof} (i.e., id token of OpenID Connect or SAML assertion).
However, SSO introduces new privacy leakage threats, since (\emph{a}) a curious IdP could track {\em all} the RPs a user has visited,
%a user's all visits to any RP
and (\emph{b}) collusive RPs could learn a user's online profile by linking her identifiers and activities across multiple RPs.
%However, the privacy leakage is an obstacle to the users' adoption of SSO,
% as the curious IdP may track at which RPs users log in,
%while collusive RPs could link the user from a common or related identifer(s) issued by the IdP.
Several privacy-preserving SSO solutions have been proposed to defend against either the curious IdP or collusive RPs, however, none of them can address both privacy leakage threats at the same time.
%Existing privacy-preserving SSO approaches protect the users' activity profiles against either the curious IdP or the collusive RPs, but never prevent both of these threats.

In this paper, we propose a privacy-preserving SSO system, called \emph{UPPRESSO}, to protect a user's login traces %at different RPs
against both the curious IdP and collusive RPs. We first formally analyze the privacy dilemma between SSO security requirements and the new privacy requirements, and convert the SSO privacy problem into an identifier-transformation problem. Then, we design a novel {\em transformed RP designation} scheme to transform the identifier of the RP, to which the user requests to log in, into a privacy-preserving pseudo-identifier ($PID_{RP}$) through the cooperation between the user and the RP. Our {\em trapdoor user identification} scheme allows the RP to obtain a trapdoor from the transformation process and use it to derive a unique account of the user at that RP from her privacy-preserving pseudo-identifier ($PID_U$) generated by the IdP.
%In each login process of UPPRESSO, the IdP that is aware of all users' identities, calculates a privacy-preserving pseudo-identifier ($PID_U$) for a user, based on the user's identity and the pseudo-identifier ($PID_{RP}$) of the visited RP. $PID_{RP}$ bound along with $PID_U$ in the identity proof, is transformed from the RP's identity cooperatively by the user and the RP, and then the IdP does not know the visited RPs. The visited RP obtains a trapdoor from the transformation of $PID_{RP}$, and then is able to use this trapdoor to derive the user's account from $PID_U$, while a user's accounts are different across the RPs.
The login process of UPPRESSO follows the service pattern of OpenID Connect (OIDC), a widely deployed SSO system, with minimum modifications.
