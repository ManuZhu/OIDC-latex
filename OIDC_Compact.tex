\title{{UPPRESSO}: An Unlinkable Privacy-PREserving Single Sign-On System}
\maketitle
\begin{abstract}
Single sign-on (SSO) services
     are widely provided in the Internet by identity providers (IdPs) as the identity management
      and authentication infrastructure.
After authenticated by the IdP,
    a user is allowed to log into relying parties (RPs) by submitting an \emph{identity proof}
    (i.e., id token of OpenID Connect or SAML assertion).
However,
    SSO introduces the potential leakage of user privacy,
        as (\emph{a}) a curious IdP could track a user's all visits to any RP
            and (\emph{b}) collusive RPs could link the user's identifiers across different RPs,
            to learn the user's activity profile.
%However, the privacy leakage is an obstacle to the users' adoption of SSO,
% as the curious IdP may track at which RPs users log in,
%while collusive RPs could link the user from a common or related identifer(s) issued by the IdP.
Existing privacy-preserving SSO solutions protect the users' activity profiles
    against either the curious IdP or the collusive RPs, but never prevent both of these threats.

In this paper, we propose a privacy-preserving SSO system, called \emph{UPPRESSO},
     to protect a user's activity profile of RP visits
        against both the curious IdP and the collusive RPs.
In each login process of UPPRESSO,
 the IdP that is aware of all users' identities,
         calculates a privacy-preserving pseudo-identifier ($PID_U$) for a user,
    based on the user's identity and the pseudo-identifier ($PID_{RP}$) of the visited RP.
$PID_{RP}$ bound along with $PID_U$ in the identity proof,
   is transformed from the RP's identity cooperatively by the user and the RP,
    and then the IdP does not know the visited RPs.
%  and binds $PID_U$ with a transformation of the RP identifier ($PID_{RP}$), without obtaining the real RP identifier.
The visited RP obtain a trapdoor from the transformation of $PID_{RP}$,
    and then is able to use this trapdoor to derive the user's account from $PID_U$,
 while a user's accounts are different across the RPs.
The login process of UPPRESSO follows the same service pattern as OpenID Connect, a widely deployed SSO system.
  %  and $PID_{RP}$ is .

%UPPRESSO is compatible with OpenID Connect, a widely deployed and well analyzed SSO system;
%    where dynamic registration is utilized to make $PID_{RP}$ valid in the IdP.
The analysis demonstrates that UPPRESSO protects user privacy well, without any degradation on the security guarantee of OpenID Connect.
We have implemented the prototype of UPPRESSO and
 the experimental evaluation shows that UPPRESSO is efficient and
  it takes only 254 ms for a user to log into an RP.
