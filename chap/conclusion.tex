In this paper, we, for the first time, propose Recluse to preserve the users' privacy from the curious IdP and colluded RPs,  without breaking the security of SSO systems. The identity proof is bound with a transformation of the original identifier, hiding the users' accessed RPs from the curious IdP. The user's account is independent for each RP, and unchanged to the destination RP who has the trapdoor, which prevents the colluded RPs from linking the users and allows the RP to provide the consecutive and individual services. The trusted user ensures the correct content and transmit of the identity proof with a self-verifying RP certificate. The evaluation demonstrates the efficiency of Recluse, about 200 ms for one user's login at a RP in our environment.
