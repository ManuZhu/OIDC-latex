\section{Implementation and Evaluation}
\label{sec:implementation}
We implemented the UPPRESSO prototype,\footnote{The prototype is open-sourced at https://github.com/uppresso/.}
 and experimentally compared it
 with two open-source SSO systems:
  (\emph{a}) MITREid Connect \cite{MITREid}
    which supports the PPID-enhanced OIDC protocol to prevent the RP-based identity linkage,
     and (\emph{b}) SPRESSO \cite{SPRESSO} preventing only the IdP-based login tracing.

%EL PASSO \cite{ELPASSO}. As a typical privacy-preserving solution of identity federation.

\subsection{Prototype Implementation}
\label{subsec:proto-imple}
The identity-transformation functions are defined on
        the NIST P256 elliptic curve.
%randomly choose a 2048-bit prime as $p$, a 256-bit prime as $q$, and the  $q$-order generators as $ID_{RP}$.
%$N_U$ and $ID_U$  are 256-bit random numbers.
%Then, the discrete logarithm problem provides equivalent security strength (i.e., 112 bits) as RSA-2048 \cite{barkerecommendation}.
RSA-2048 and SHA-256 are adopted as the signature algorithm and the hash function, respectively.
%in  the $Cert_{RP}$, identity token and RP identifier refreshing result.

The IdP is built on top of MITREid Connect \cite{MITREid},
    an open-source OIDC Java implementation, %certificated by the OpenID Foundation \cite{OIDF},
    and only small modifications are needed.
We add only 3 lines of Java code to calculate $PID_U$,
    and 20 lines to modify the way to send identity tokens.
The calculations of $ID_{RP}$ and $PID_U$ are implemented based on built-in Java cryptographic libraries.

We implemented the user functions by the IdP and RP scripts,
     with about 160 and 140 lines of JavaScript code, respectively.
%to provide the functions in Steps 2.1, 2.3, and 4.3.
The cryptographic computations, e.g., $Cert_{RP}$ verification and $PID_{RP}$ negotiation, are finished based on jsrsasign \cite{jsrsasign}, an efficient JavaScript cryptographic library.
%This chrome extension requires permissions  \emph{chrome.tabs} and \emph{chrome.windows} to obtain the RP's URL from the browser's tab,  and \emph{chrome.webRequest} to intercept, block, modify requests to the IdP or RP \cite{chromeExtension}.

%send HTTPS request/reply and hijack the HTTPS responses, to obtain the RP's URL and communicate with IdP and RP.
%and 30 lines  Chrome extension configuration files (specifying the required permissions, such as reading chrome tab information, sending the HTTP request, blocking the received HTTP response). to access to privileged fields of the Tab objects including

%Here, the cross-origin HTTPS requests sent by this chrome extension to the RP and IdP, will be blocked by Chrome due to the default same-origin security policy.
%To avoid this block, UPPRESSO modifies the IdP and RP, and sets \verb+chrome-extension://chrome-id+ (\verb+chrome-id+ is uniquely assigned by Google) in \verb+Access-Control-Allow-Origin+ header of the IdP's and RP's responses.

%Moreover, the chrome extension needs to construct cross-origin requests to communicate with the RP and IdP, which is forbidden by the default same-origin security policy. Therefore it is required to add the HTTP header \verb+Access-Control-Allow-Origin+ in the response of IdP and RP to accept only the request from the origin \verb+chrome-extension://chrome-id+ (\verb+chrome-id+ is uniquely assigned by the Google).

We provide a Java RP SDK.
The SDK provides two functions to encapsulate the protocol steps:
 one to request identity tokens,
    and the other to derive the accounts. %from identity tokens.
It is implemented based on the Spring Boot framework  with about 500 lines of Java code
 and cryptographic computations are finished based on the Spring Security library.
An RP invokes these functions for the integration,
    by less than 10 lines of Java code.
