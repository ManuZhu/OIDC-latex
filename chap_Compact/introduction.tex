%SSO的特点
%SSO的现状
Single sign-on (SSO) systems, such as OpenID Connect~\cite{OpenIDConnect}, OAuth~\cite{rfc6749} and SAML~\cite{SAML}, have been widely deployed as the identity management and authentication infrastructure in the Internet.
SSO enables a website, called the \emph{relying party} (RP), to delegate its user authentication to a trusted third party called the \emph{identity provider} (IdP).
Thus, a user visits multiple RPs with only a single explicit authentication attempt at the IdP.
With the help of SSO, a user no longer needs to remember multiple credentials for different RPs;
 instead, she maintains only the credential for the IdP, which will generate \emph{identity proofs} for her visits to these RPs.
%        Moreover, SSO shifts the burden of user authentication from RPs to IdPs and reduces security risks and costs at RPs.
As a result, SSO has been widely integrated with many application services.
For example,
    we find that 80\% of the Alexa Top-100 websites~\cite{Alexa} support SSO,
 and the analysis on the Alexa Top-1M websites~\cite{GhasemisharifRC18} identifies 6.30\% with the SSO support.
Meanwhile, many email and social network providers (such as Google, Facebook, Twitter, etc.)
    are serving the IdP roles in the Internet. %social identity providers to support social login.


%SSO系统的安全问题，需要保护identity proof的完整性，机密性，绑定性
%完整性：使用公开的为受保护的信息作为identity proof
%机密性：保证由IdP发送给对应的RP，并且传输过程中通道、user agent都是受到保护的
%绑定性：identity proof一定要与对应的RP实现绑定
%SPRESSO中关于impersonation和identity injection的描述。 Authentication is the most fundamental security property of an SSO system. That is, i) an adversary should not be able to log in to an RP, and hence, use the service of the RP, as an honest user, and ii) an adversary should not be able to log in the browser of an honest user under an adversary’s identity (identity injection).

%完整性原文描述 IEEE S&P2012~\cite{WangCW12}关于Google问题描述we found that the RPs of Google ID SSO often assume that message fields they require Google to sign would always be signed, which turns out to be a serious misunderstanding (Section 4.1). These problems make us believe that a complete answer to our question can only be found by analyzing SSO schemes on real websites.

%The primary goal of SSO services is to implement secure user authentication~\cite{SPRESSO}, i.e., to ensure that an honest user can always log in to an honest RP under the correct account. To achieve this, an identity proof generated by the IdP should explicitly specify the authenticated user (i.e., \emph{user identification}) and the RP to which the user attempts to log in (i.e., \emph{receiver designation}). The identify proof should be received only by that RP and user but not by any other entities (i.e., \emph{confidentiality}) and verified by the receiver (i.e., \emph{integrity}). However, various attacks exploit vulnerabilities in different SSO systems to break at least one of these requirements~\cite{ChenPCTKT14, FettKS16,WangCW12,ZhouE14,WangZLG16,YangLLZH16,SomorovskyMSKJ12,MohsenS16}, where the adversaries attempt to either impersonate the victim user at an honest RP or %manipulate the victim user's browser to log in to honest RPs under the adversary's identity. %(i.e., identity injection). For example, Friendcaster was found to accept any received identity proof~\cite{ExplicatingSDK,ChenPCTKT14} (i.e., a violation of receiver designation) so that a malicious RP could log in to Friendcaster as the victim user by replaying the identity proof received from the user to Friendcaster~\cite{MohsenS16}. \cite{WangCW12} reported that some RPs of Google ID SSO accepted user attributes that were not tied to the identity proof (i.e., a potential violation of integrity). As a result, a malicious user could insert arbitrary attributes (e.g., an email address) into the identity proof to impersonate another user at the RP.


%SSO 引入新的隐私问题

The adoption of SSO also raises several privacy concerns regarding online user tracking and profiling~\cite{maler2008venn,NIST2017draft}.
User privacy leaks in all existing SSO protocols and implementations.
Taking a widely used SSO protocol, OpenID Connect (OIDC), as an example, we explain its login process and the privacy leakage risk. As shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:OpenID}, upon receiving a user login request (Step 1), the RP constructs an authentication request with its identity and redirects it to the IdP (Step 2).
After authenticating the user, the IdP  generates an identify proof containing the identities of the user and the RP in Step 4, which is forwarded to the RP by the user in Step 5. Finally, the RP verifies the identity proof and allows the user to log in. In such authentication sessions, any curious IdP or multiple collusive RPs can easily break users' privacy as follows.
\begin{itemize}
\item {\em IdP-based login tracing}. The IdP knows the identities of the RP and user in a single authentication session in Step 2 and Step 3, respectively. As a result, a curious IdP could easily discover all the RPs that the victim user attempts to visit and profile her online activities.
\item {\em RP-based identity linkage}. The RP learns user's identity from the identify proof. When the IdP generates identity proofs for a user, if a same user identifier is used in identity proofs generated for different RPs, % or the user's identifiers can be derived from each other,
which is the case of several widely deployed SSO systems~\cite{BrowserID,SPRESSO}, malicious RPs can collude to not only link the user's login activities at different RPs for online tracking but also correlate her attributes across multiple RPs~\cite{maler2008venn}.
\end{itemize}

%1. service provider（如DNS）知道你访问了，可以带来很多问题。但是还是不同的，DNS里profile需要评估的是two behavior vectors的similarities，而IdP中都不需要，因为IdP能够区分two behavior vectors 是否来自相同节点。

Large IdPs, especially social IdPs such as Google and Facebook, are known to be interested in collecting users' online behavioral information for various purposes (e.g., Screenwise Meter~\cite{googlenews}, Onavo~\cite{Onavo}). By simply serving the IdP role, these companies can easily collect a large amount of data to reconstruct users' online traces.
On the other hand, in today's Internet, many service providers host a variety of web services and therefore take an advantaged position to link a user's multiple logins at different RPs. Through an internal information integration, rich information can be obtained from the SSO data for user profiling. Meanwhile, privacy-preserving record linkage~\cite{agrawal2003information} and private set intersection~\cite{de2010practical} technologies allow multiple organizations (e.g., RPs) to share and link the data without violating their clients' privacy, which has paved the path for cross-organizational RP-based identity linkage.

While the privacy problems in SSO have been widely recognized~\cite{maler2008venn,NIST2017draft}, only a few solutions were proposed to protect user privacy~\cite{persona,SPRESSO}. Among them, Pairwise Pseudonymous Identifier (PPID)~\cite{OpenIDConnect, SAMLIdentifier} is a most straightforward and commonly adopted solution to defend against RP-based identity linkage. It requires the IdP to create different identifiers for the user when she logs in to different RPs, so that the pairwise pseudo-identifiers of the same user cannot be used to link user logins at different RPs no matter they collude or not. As a recommended practice by NIST~\cite{NIST2017draft}, PPID has been specified in many widely adopted SSO standards including OIDC~\cite{OpenIDConnect} and SAML~\cite{SAMLIdentifier}. However, PPID-based approaches cannot prevent the IdP-based login tracing attacks, as the IdP still knows which RP the user visits.

To the best of our knowledge, only two schemes (i.e., BrowserID~\cite{BrowserID} and SPRESSO~\cite{SPRESSO}) have been proposed so far to defend against IdP-based login tracing.
In BrowserID (and its prototype system known as Mozilla Persona~\cite{persona} and Firefox Accounts~\cite{FirefoxAccount}), IdP generates a user certificate to bind the user's unique identifier (i.e., email address) to a public key. With the corresponding private key, that user can bind the receiving RP's identifier to the identity proof %(including the user certificate),
and send it to that RP. In this way, the IdP does not need to know the RP's identity when generating identify proofs.
SPRESSO requires the RP to create a pseudo-identifier at each login for the IdP to generate the identity proof and therefore hides RP's real identity from the IdP. The RP employs a third-party entity (named {\em forwarder}), which works as a proxy to relay the identity proof from the IdP to the corresponding RP. In both schemes, the RPs' identifiers are protected from the IdP, however, the IdP has to know the unique identifier (e.g., email address) of the user and includes it in the identity proofs so that the RP can recognize a same user from her multiple logins. As a result, both schemes are vulnerable to RP-based linkage.

As discussed above, none of the existing SSO systems can defend against both IdP-based login tracing and RP-based identity linkage attacks at the same time. Before presenting our solution, we first formally analyze the privacy problems and solutions in SSO. Let us denote user's and RP's identifiers as $ID_U$ and $ID_{RP}$, respectively, where $ID_U$ is known to the user and IdP and $ID_{RP}$ is known to the user and RP. To protect user's privacy against RP-based identity linkage, $ID_U$ should not be explicitly included in the identity proof. Instead, a privacy-preserving pseudo-identifier $PID_{U}$ should be used (as in the PPID-based approaches~\cite{OpenIDConnect, SAMLIdentifier}), which can be generated by a one-way identifier transformation function $\mathcal{F}_{ID_{U} \mapsto PID_{U}}$ at the IdP. Similarly, to prevent IdP-based login tracing, $ID_{RP}$ should not be explicitly included in the identity proof but replaced by a pseudo-identifier $PID_{RP}$ (as in SPRESSO~\cite{SPRESSO} and BrowserID~\cite{BrowserID}), which is generated by another one-way function $\mathcal{F}_{ID_{RP} \mapsto PID_{RP}}$ at the RP. However, if both $PID_{U}$ and $PID_{RP}$ are used in identity proofs to replace $ID_U$ and $ID_{RP}$ at the same time, assuming they can be securely exchanged between IdP and RP through the user in an SSO session, the RP will authenticate and authorize the user under the account $PID_U$, which will be different in the user's multiple logins at a same RP. As a result, the RP has no clue to know the real account of the user but treats her as a one-time user every time when she logs in. Obviously, this violates the security of SSO services.

In this paper, we propose an Unlinkable Privacy-PREserving Single Sign-On (UPPRESSO) system to provide comprehensive protection against IdP-based login tracing and RP-based identity linkage. The key idea is to design a new one-way identifier transformation function $\mathcal{F}_{PID_{U} \mapsto Account}$, which maps {\em all} $PID_U$s of a user to a unique $Account$ at the RP, where $Account$ is created when the user first registers at the RP. Since $PID_U$ and $PID_{RP}$ are separately generated by IdP and RP respectively at every authentication session, we have to design new $\mathcal{F}_{ID_{U} \mapsto PID_{U}}$ and $\mathcal{F}_{ID_{RP} \mapsto PID_{RP}}$ functions, so that three transformation functions work cooperatively to ensure: (i) when a user logs in to an RP multiple times, the RP can always map $PID_U$s to an unique $Account$ without knowing the user's identity; when a user logs in to multiple RPs, (ii) a curious IdP cannot link multiple $PID_{RP}$s to a particular RP or associate them together, and collusive RPs (iii) cannot link $PID_U$s to a particular user or associate them together, (iv) nor link $Account$s of a same user. To achieve these goals, we design three one-way transformation functions based on the discrete logarithm problem. First, we design a one-way trapdoor function $\mathcal{F}_{ID_{RP} \mapsto PID_{RP}}(ID_{RP}, t)$ for an RP to generate a random $PID_{RP}$ based on a randomly chosen trapdoor $t$, and a one-way function  $\mathcal{F}_{ID_{U} \mapsto PID_{U}}(ID_U, PID_{RP})$ for the IdP to generate $PID_U$ based on $PID_{RP}$. With $ID_{RP}$, $PID_{RP}$, $PID_U$ and the trapdoor $t$, the RP can invoke $\mathcal{F}_{PID_{U} \mapsto Account}(PID_U, PID_{RP}, t)$ to derive the unique $Account$. We summarize our contributions as follows.

%The main contributions of UPPRESSO are as follows:
\begin{itemize}
\item We formally analyze the privacy problems in SSO as an identifier-transformation problem, and propose the first comprehensive solution to hide users' login traces from both curious IdPs and malicious, collusive RPs. To the best of our knowledge, UPPRESSO is the first SSO system that provides secure SSO services against IdP-based login tracing and RP-based identity linkage.
\item We have implemented a prototype of UPPRESSO based on an open-source implementation of OIDC, which requires only small modifications to support three new transformation functions for privacy protection. Unlike  BrowserID and SPRESSO, UPPRESSO does not require ``non-trivial re-designs'' of SSO implementations, which makes it compatible with existing SSO systems.
\item We systematically analyze  the security of UPPRESSO and show that it achieves the same security level as existing SSO systems.
\item We compare the performance of UPPRESSO prototype with the state-of-the-art SSO systems (i.e., OIDC and SPRESSO), and demonstrate its efficiency.
