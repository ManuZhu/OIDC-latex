\section{The Analysis of Security and Privacy}
\label{sec:analysis}
In this section, we presents the analysis that UPPRESSO achieves the required properties of security and privacy.


\subsection{Security}
UPPRESSO satisfies the four security requirements of identity tokens in SSO services,
     as listed in Section \ref{subsec:basicrequirements}.
\begin{itemize}
\item  \textbf{RP Designation}~The RP (pseudo-)identity bound in the identity token
     identifies the target RP, and only this RP.
 % 仅有一个RP与之对应。
\item \textbf{User Identification}~The user (pseudo-)identity bound in the identity token identifies
        the user authenticated by the IdP, and only this user.
 % 能够被算出来的account，对应了the authenticated user；而且仅有这个user
\item \textbf{Confidentiality}~An identity token issued by the IdP,
    is accessible to only
                the authenticated user and the target RP,
                    in addition to the IdP.
\item \textbf{Integrity}~An honest RP accepts only identity tokens issued by the IdP,
            and any forged or modified identity token will be rejected by the RP.
\end{itemize}


%while the detailed process of proof is provided in the Appendix.

\noindent\textbf{RP Designation.}
The identity token binds $PID_{RP}$ identifying the target RP,
    because $t$ is sent the target RP with $ID_{RP}$ and $PID_{RP} = [t]ID_{RP}$.


Next, we prove that the adversaries' probability of finding $t$ and $t'$
    satisfying that $[t]ID_{RP_j} = [t']ID_{RP_{j'}}$ (i.e., the token identifies only the target RP) is negligible,
    where $RP_j$ and $RP_{j'}$ are any two RPs of the finite set of RPs,
    based on the ECDLP.
Note that $ID_{RP_j} = [r_j]G$ and $ID_{RP_{j'}} = [r_{j'}]G$, while $r_j$ and $r_{j'}$ are kept secret to the adversaries. 
Let $\mathbb{E}$ be an elliptic curve over a finite field $\mathbb{F}_q$,
    $G$ be a point on $\mathbb{E}$ of order $n$,
        and $Q = [x]G$ where $x$ is an integer number randomly  chosen from $Z^+_n$.
Given $G$ and $Q$,
    the probability of a probabilistic polynomial time (PPT) algorithm $\mathcal{D}$ calculating $x$ (i.e., to solve the ECDLP) is negligible.
Let ${\rm Pr}\{\}$ denote the probability.
For any PPT algorithm $\mathcal{D}$, we define
\begin{align*}
{\rm Pr}\{\mathcal{D}(G, [x]G)=x\} = \epsilon_{ECDLP}(k)
\end{align*}
So $\epsilon_{ECDLP}(k)$ is negligible with the security parameter $k$.

We assume a game $\mathcal{G}_c$ between an adversary and a challenger,
    to describe the attack breaking RP designation:
the adversary receives a finite set of RP identities from the challenger,
 denoted as ($ID_{RP_1}$, $ID_{RP_2}$, ..., $ID_{RP_m}$),
 where $m$ is the amount of RPs in the system,
  and then outputs $(a, b, t, t')$.
If $[t]ID_{RP_a}=[t']ID_{RP_b}$, the adversary succeeds in this game.
%If the adversary has the non-negligible probability on succeeding in this game, RP designation is broken.
Note that $m$ is a finite integer number, but $m << 2^k$.

We define the probability that the adversary succeeds in this game as ${\rm Pr}_s$.
So, if the adversary is able to find $t$ and $t'$
    satisfying that $[t]ID_{RP_j} = [t']ID_{RP_{j'}}$,
    the adversary will have non-negligible advantages in $\mathcal{G}_c$
        and ${\rm Pr}_s$ is non-negligible. That is,  
\begin{align*}
{\rm Pr}_s > \epsilon_{ECDLP}(k)
\end{align*}

\begin{figure}[tb]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.9\linewidth]{fig/ecdlp_algorithm.pdf}
  \caption{The algorithm based on the $PID_{RP}$ collision, to solve the ECDLP.}
  \label{fig:ecdlp_algorithm}
\end{figure}

However, if the adversary has non-negligible advantages in $\mathcal{G}_c$,
    we will design a PPT algorithm $\mathcal{D}^*_c$ based on this game, shown in Figure~\ref{fig:ecdlp_algorithm}, to solve the ECDLP as below.
The input of $\mathcal{D}^*_c$ is in the form of ($G$, $Q$).
On receiving the input, the challenger of $\mathcal{G}_c$ randomly chooses $r_1, r_2, \cdots, r_m \in Z^+_n$,
 calculates $[r_1]G, [r_2]G, \cdots, [r_m]G$,
 and randomly replaces some $[r_j]G$ with the input $Q$.
Then,
    these $m$ RP identities are sent to the adversary,
and the adversary returns the result ($a$, $b$, $t$, $t'$).
Finally, the challenger calculates $s = t^{-1}t'r_b \bmod n$ and returns $s$ as the output of $\mathcal{D}^*_c$.

If $[r_a]G$ happens to be replaced with $Q$ and the adversary succeeds,
    we find that $Q = [s]G$ and then $s=x$ because $[tr_a]G = [t]Q = [t'r_b]G$.
As $[r_j]G$ is randomly replaced by the challenger,
    $Q$ and other RP identities in the input set are indistinguishable to the adversary.
Thus,
\begin{align*}
&{\rm Pr}\{\mathcal{D}^*_c(G, [x]G)=x\} = {\rm Pr}\{s = x\}={\rm Pr}\{a=j\}{\rm Pr}_s=\frac{1}{m}{\rm Pr}_s
\end{align*}
As there is $m << 2^k$, therefore, 
\begin{align*}
{\rm Pr}_s = m\cdot {\rm Pr}\{\mathcal{D}^*_c(G, [x]G)=x\}=\epsilon_{ECDLP}(k)
\end{align*}

Thus, ${\rm Pr}_s$ is negligible with the security parameter $k$, which means the adversary does not have non-negligible advantages in $\mathcal{G}_c$. So, the probability of finding $t$ and $t'$ satisfying that $[t]ID_{RP_j} = [t']ID_{RP_{j'}}$ in UPPRESSO is negligible. 


%If ${\rm Pr}_s$ is non-negligible with the security parameter $k$, ${\rm Pr}\{\mathcal{D}^*_c(G, [x]G)=x\} =\frac{1}{m}{\rm Pr}_s$ is also non-negligible because $m << 2^k$,
%which means that $\mathcal{D}^*_c$ solves the ECDLP.
%So the adversary does not have non-negligible advantages in $\mathcal{G}_c$,
%    and the probability of finding $t$ and $t'$
%    satisfying that $[t]ID_{RP_j} = [t']ID_{RP_{j'}}$ in UPPRESSO is negligible. 


%An identity token binding $PID_U$ and $PID_{RP}$,
%    designates the target RP, and only the target RP.
%An honest RP calculates $PID_{RP}$ by itself with the trapdoor $t$ sent from the user,
%    and checks $PID_{RP}$ in the $PID_{RP}$-registration result and the identity token.
%So the target RP will accept this token.

%Meanwhile,
%        the honest IdP guarantees that, within its validity period, the $PID_{RP}$ will be registered only once.
% $PID_{RP}$ will be bound in some identity token.
%An honest RP is ready to accept an identity token binding $PID_{RP}$, only after it receives the signed $PID_{RP}$-registration result.
%Because (\emph{a}) both $PID_{RP}$ and $H(t)$ in the registration result are checked by the RP and then (\emph{b}) the registration result $[PID_{RP}, H(t), Validity]_{SK}$ is acceptable to only one honest RP,
%            the identity token designates only one RP.

\vspace{1mm}
\noindent\textbf{User Identification.}
Given a user, an honest RP with $ID_{RP}$ always deterministically derives an identical account from different identity tokens binding $PID_U$ and $PID_{RP}$.
That is,
    in the user's any $i$-th and $i'$-th ($i \neq i'$) login instances to the RP,
 $\mathcal{F}_{Acct}(PID_{U}^i, PID_{RP}^i) = \mathcal{F}_{Acct}(PID_{U}^{i'}, PID_{RP}^{i'}) = [ID_U]ID_{RP}$.

In the calculation of $Acct = [t^{-1}]PID_U = [t^{-1}][u]PID_{RP}$,
%$t$ and $PID_{RP}$ have been checked by the honest RP in the $PID_{RP}$-registration result,
$PID_U$ is calculated by the honest IdP based on (\emph{a}) the authenticated user, i.e., $ID_U = u$, and (\emph{b}) the received $PID_{RP}$, while this $PID_{RP}$ is generated by the honest RP based on $ID_{RP}$ and $t$.
Thus, the calculated account is always exactly the authenticated user's account at the RP (i.e., $[ID_U]ID_{RP}$).
%Moreover, adversary may try to provide the
%However, according to the proof of RP designation, there would not be the generated $t$ and $t'$ happening to satisfy that $PID_{RP} = [t]ID_{RP_j} = [tr]G = [t'r']G = [t']ID_{RP_{j'}}$.


%Two malicious users, whose identities are $ID_U = u$ and $ID_{U'} = u'$,
%    could attempt to login to $RP_j$ and $RP_{j'}$, respectively.
%If the generated $t$ and $t'$ happen to satisfy that $PID_{RP} = [t]ID_{RP_j} = [tr]G = [t'r']G = [t']ID_{RP_{j'}}$,
%    these collusive users could arbitrarily choose to register either $[PID_{RP}, PEnpt_U, H(t)]$ or $[PID_{RP}, PEnpt_{U'}, H(t')]$ at the IdP,
%        to receive an identity token binding $PID_{RP}$ and either $PID_U = [u]PID_{RP}$ or $PID_{U'} = [u']PID_{RP}$.\footnote{Such a token designates either $RP_j$ or $RP_{j'}$,
%    but only one honest RP because there is only one acceptable $PID_{RP}$-registration result which is signed by the IdP.
%    So RP designation is not violated in this attack case.}
%When such a token is signed for $RP_j$, the calculated $Acct$ is $[ur]G$ or $[u'r't't^{-1}]G = [u'r]G$;
%    or, when it is signed for $RP_{j'}$, $[urtt'^{-1}]G = [ur']G$ or $[u'r']G$ is calculated.
%That is,
%        even in this collusive case,
%    the calculated account is still the authenticated user's account at the target RP,
%    and it does not result in any attack.


%An adversary might try allure a user to login under the adversary's account,
%    by injecting his identity token into the user's communications with an honest RP.
%Such identity injection attacks are impossible in UPPRESSO as follows.
%If the negotiation of $PID_{RP}$ is not finished yet,
%    the RP will reject the malicious token.
%Even when $PID_{RP}$ has been negotiated,
%    it is kept unknown to the adversary because the communications between two scripts are controlled by a browser
%     and the communications between the browser and the IdP (or the RP) are protected by TLS.
%Thus, an adversary cannot obtain $PID_{RP}$ dynamically negotiated between an honest RP and the user,
%     so it cannot construct an identity token acceptable to the RP.
%

\vspace{1mm}
\noindent\textbf{Confidentiality.}
No event leaks the identity tokens to any malicious entity other than the authenticated user and the designated RP.
First of all, the communications among the IdP, RPs and users,
    are protected by HTTPS,
    and the \verb+postMessage+ HTML5 API ensures the dedicated channels between two scripts within the browser,
    so that adversaries cannot eavesdrop the identity tokens.
Meanwhile, the honest IdP sends the identity token only to the authenticated user
        (i.e., the IdP script in the browser).
The IdP script forwards the token to the RP script
 only if it is downloaded from the same origin as $Enpt_{RP}$,
and the binding of $Enpt_{RP}$ and $ID_{RP}$ is ensured by the signed RP certificate,
    which is also verified by the IdP script.
So only the designated target RP that holds $Enpt_{RP}$ and $ID_{RP}$ in the certificate,
    receives this token.


%The detailed process of proof is shown in Appendix.

\vspace{1mm}
\noindent\textbf{Integrity.}
The identity token binds $Acct$ and $ID_{RP}$ implicitly,
    and any breaking will result in some failed check or verification in the login flow.
The integrity is ensured by the IdP's signatures:
    the identity token binding $PID_U$ and $PID_{RP}$ is signed by the IdP.
According to the proof of RP designation,
    there is no $t' \neq t$ but satisfying that $PID_{RP} = [t]ID_{RP_j} = [tr]G = [t'r']G = [t']ID_{RP_{j'}}$.
That is, the identity token explicitly binding $PID_U$ and $PID_{RP}$,
    matches only one $ID_{RP}$ (and also only one $Acct = [t^{-1}]PID_{U}$).
Thus,
    $Acct$ and $ID_{RP}$ are actually bound by the IdP's signatures,
        due to the one-to-one mapping between (\emph{a}) the pair of $Acct$ and $ID_{RP}$ and (\emph{b}) the triad of $PID_U$, $PID_{RP}$, and $t$.

%The detailed process of proof is shown in Appendix.

\vspace{1mm}
We also formally analyze the security properties of UPPRESSO,
     based on an Dolev-Yao style model of the web infrastructure \cite{SPRESSO},
 which has been used in the formal analysis of SSO protocols such as OAuth 2.0 \cite{FettKS16} and OIDC \cite{FettKS17}.
The Dolev-Yao style model abstracts the entities in a web system,
    such as browsers and web servers,
    as {\em atomic processes}, which communicate with each other through {\em events}.
It also defines {\em script processes} to formulate client-side scripts, i.e.,  JavaScript code.
 % so a web system consists of a set of atomic and script processes.

The UPPRESSO system contains an IdP process,
    a finite set of web servers for honest RPs, a finite set of honest browsers, and a finite set of attacker processes.
Here, we consider all RP processes and browser processes are honest,
 while model an RP or a browser controlled by an adversary as atomic attacker processes.
It also contains {\sf script\_rp} and {\sf script\_idp},  % and {\sf script\_attacker},
    where {\sf script\_rp} and {\sf script\_idp} are honest scripts downloaded from an RP process and the IdP process, respectively.
 %        and {\sf script\_attacker} denotes a script downloaded by an attacker process that exists in all browser processes.

After formulating UPPRESSO by the Dolev-Yao style model,
    we trace the identity token,
        starting when it is generated and ending when accepted by the RP,
 to ensure that an identity token is not leaked or tampered with.
We locate the generation of an identity token in UPPRESSO, and trace back to the places
    where $PID_U$, $PID_{RP}$ and other parameters enclosed in this token are generated and transmitted,
     to ensure that no adversary is able to retrieve or manipulate them.
The tracing of identity tokens also confirm no adversary retrieves the token.

%The details on the Dolev-Yao web model and the detailed security proofs of UPPRESSO are in the appendix.

%Finally,
%    we formally prove that,
%\emph{user identification}, \emph{RP designation}, \emph{confidentiality}, and \emph{integrity} are fulfilled in UPPRESSO.


\subsection{Privacy}
UPPRESSO effectively prevents the attacks of IdP-based login tracing and RP-based identity linkage.

\vspace{1mm}
\noindent\textbf{IdP-based Login Tracing.}
The information accessible to the IdP and derived from the RP's identity,
    is only $PID_{RP}$, where $PID_{RP} = [t]ID_{RP}$ is calculated by the user.
Because  (\emph{a}) $t$ is a number randomly chosen from $Z^+_n$ by the user and kept secret to the IdP
 and (\emph{b}) $ID_{RP} = [r]G$ and $G$ is the base point (or generator) of $\mathbb{E}$,
 the IdP has to view $PID_{RP}$ as randomly and independently chosen from $\mathbb{E}$,
    and cannot distinguish $[t]ID_{RP_j} = [tr]G$ from any $[t']ID_{RP_{j'}} = [t'r']G$.
So, the IdP cannot derive the RP's identity or link any pair of $PID_{RP}^i$ and $PID_{RP}^{i'}$,
    and then the IdP-based login tracing is impossible.

\vspace{1mm}
\noindent\textbf{RP-based Identity Linkage.}
We prove that UPPRESSO prevents the RP-based identity linkage,
 based on the elliptic curve decision Diffie-Hellman (ECDDH) assumption \cite{GoldwasserK16}.
%That is, while there is the login to an RP, for colluded RPs, they cannot decide whether this login and any logins to other RPs are from the same user.
%
Let $\mathbb{E}$ be an elliptic curve over a finite field $\mathbb{F}_q$,
    and $G$ be a point on $\mathbb{E}$ of order $n$.
For any PPT algorithm $\mathcal{D}$, the probability of distinguishing
 $([x]G$, $[y]G$, $[xy]G)$ and $([x]G$, $[y]G$, $[z]G)$
is negligible,
 where $x$, $y$ and $z$ are integer numbers randomly and independently chosen from $Z^+_n$.
Let  ${\rm Pr}\{\}$ denote the probability and
 we define
\begin{align*}
&{\rm Pr}_1 =  {\rm Pr}\{\mathcal{D}(G, [x]G, [y]G, [xy]G)=1\} \\
&{\rm Pr}_2 =  {\rm Pr}\{\mathcal{D}(G, [x]G, [y]G, [z]G)=1\} \\
& \epsilon_{ECDDHP}(k) = |{\rm Pr}_1 - {\rm Pr}_2|
\end{align*}
Then, $\epsilon_{ECDDHP}(k)$ is negligible with the security parameter $k$.


In a login instance,
    the RP holds $ID_{RP}$ and $Acct$, receives $t$, calculates $PID_{RP}$,
    and verifies $PID_{RP}$ and $PID_U$ in the identity token.
After filtering out the redundant information (i.e., $PID_{RP}= [t]{ID_{RP}}$ and $Acct = [t^{-1}]PID_{U}$),
    the RP actually receives $(ID_{RP}, t, Acct)$ in each UPPRESSO login instance, where $ID_{RP} = [r]G$ and $Acct = [ID_U]{ID_{RP}} = [ur]G$.

The prevention against the RP-based identity linkage is proved
    by the proposition:
when $c$ collusive RPs collect the information of login instances by $v$ users,
    they cannot determine whether a login instance to another RP belongs to one of these users or not.
The information of login instances is expressed as $\mathfrak{L}=\left\{ \begin{matrix}
L_{1,1}, & L_{1,2}, & \cdots, & L_{1,c}\\
L_{2,1}, & L_{2,2}, & \cdots, & L_{2,c}\\
\cdots, & \cdots, & \cdots, & \cdots\\
L_{v,1}, & L_{v,2}, & \cdots, & L_{v,c}
\end{matrix}\right\}$, where $L_{i, j} = (ID_{RP_j}, t_{i, j}, [ID_{U_i}]{ID_{RP_j}}) = ([r_j]G, t_{i,j}, [u_ir_j]G)$.
Given a login instance to another RP $L'=(ID_{RP_{c+1}}, t', [ID_{U'}]ID_{RP_{c+1}}) = ([r_{c+1}]G, t', [u'r_{c+1}]G)$,
we define the game $\mathcal{G}_r$  as follows:
after receiving $\mathfrak{L}$ and $L'$ from a challenger,
    an adversary outputs the result $s = 1$ if it determines that $u' \in \{u_1, u_2, \cdots, u_v\}$,
        or $s = 0$ otherwise.
        
        We define the probability that the adversary's advantage in this game as ${\rm Pr}_a$.
So, if the adversary is able to distinguish whether $u' \in \{u_1, u_2, \cdots, u_v\}$,
    the adversary will have non-negligible advantages in $\mathcal{G}_r$
        and ${\rm Pr}_a$ is non-negligible. That is,  
\begin{align*}
&{\rm Pr}'_1={\rm Pr}\{\mathcal{G}_r(\mathfrak{L}, L'|ID_{U'} \in \{ID_{U_1}, ID_{U_2}, \cdots, ID_{U_v}\})=1\} \\
&{\rm Pr}'_2={\rm Pr}\{\mathcal{G}_r(\mathfrak{L}, L'|ID_{U'} \in Z^+_n)=1\}\\
&{\rm Pr}_a=|{\rm Pr}'_1-{\rm Pr}'_2|>\epsilon_{ECDDHP}(k)
\end{align*}

%In UPPRESSO system, the $ID_U$, $ID_{RP}$ and $t$ are not generated by RP, or generated based on any data provided RP, therefore, as long as UPPRESSO is proved IND-COA (Indistinguishability under Ciphertext-Only Attack) security, the requirement is satisfied and the RP-based identity linkage is impossible in UPPRESSO system.

\begin{figure}[tb]

  \includegraphics[width=0.95\linewidth]{fig/dalgorithm.pdf}
  \caption{The algorithm based on the RP-based identity linkage, to solve the ECDDH problem.}
  \label{fig:dalgorithm}
\end{figure}

We design a PPT algorithm $\mathcal{D}^*_r$ based on $\mathcal{G}_r$, shown in Figure~\ref{fig:dalgorithm}, to solve the ECDDH problem.
The input of $\mathcal{D}^*_r$ is in the form of $(G$, $Q_1=[x]G$, $Q_2=[y]G$, $Q_3=[z]G)$.
On receiving the input, the challenger of $\mathcal{G}_r$ randomly chooses
 $\{u_1, u_2, \cdots, u_v\}$, $\{r_1, r_2, \cdots, r_c\}$, $\{t_{1, 1}, t_{1, 2}, \cdots, t_{v, c}\}$, and $t'$ from $Z^+_n$.
Then the challenger constructs $\mathfrak{L}$ and $L'$ as below.
It first assigns $L_{i, j} = ([r_j]G, t_{i, j}, [u_ir_j]G)$, %$1\leq i \leq v$ and $1\leq j \leq c$,
    and randomly chooses $k \in [1, v]$ to
 replace $[u_k r_j]G$ with $[r_j]Q_1=[x][r_j]G$, $1\leq j \leq c$.
So $\mathfrak{L}=\left \{ \begin{matrix}
L_{1,1},&L_{1,2},&\cdots,&L_{1,c}\\
L_{2,1},& L_{2,2},&\cdots,&L_{2,c}\\
\cdots,&\cdots,&\cdots,&\cdots\\
([r_{1}]G, t_{k, 1}, [r_{1}]Q_1),&\cdots,&\cdots,&([r_{c}]G, t_{k, c}, [r_{c}]Q_1)\\
\cdots,&\cdots,&\cdots,&\cdots\\
L_{v,1},&L_{v,2},&\cdots,&L_{v,c}
\end{matrix}\right\}$.
%$L=$\{($[r_1]G$, $t_{1, 1}$, $[[u_1][r_1]G$), ($[r_2]G$, $t_{1, 2}$, $[u_1][r_2]G$), $\cdots$, ($[r_{\beta}]G$, $t_{\alpha, \beta}$, $[r_{\beta}]Q_1$), $\cdots$, ($[r_b]G$, $t_{a, b}$, $[u_a][r_b]G$)\}

Next, it constructs $L' = (Q_2, t', Q_3) = ([y]G, t', [z/y][y]G)$.
Finally,
    the challenger sends $\mathfrak{L}$ and $L'$ to the adversary,
        and then the output $s$ of $\mathcal{G}_r$ is output by the challenger.
According to the construction of $\mathfrak{L}$ and $L'$,
    $x$ is actually inserted into $\mathfrak{L}$ as $u_k$,
    and $z/y$ is assigned to $u'$.
So, if $z = xy$, $ID_{U'}\in$\{$ID_{U_1}, ID_{U_2}, \cdots, ID_{U_v}$\}.
Thus,
\begin{align*}
&{\rm Pr}_1={\rm Pr}\{\mathcal{D}^*_r(G, [x]G, [y]G, [xy]G)=1\}\\=&{\rm Pr}'_1 =  {\rm Pr}\{\mathcal{G}_r(\mathfrak{L}, L'|ID_{U'} \in \{ID_{U_1}, ID_{U_2}, \cdots, ID_{U_v}\})=1\} \\
&{\rm Pr}_2={\rm Pr}\{\mathcal{D'^*}(G, [x]G, [y]G, [z]G)=1\}\\ =&{\rm Pr}'_2 =  {\rm Pr}\{\mathcal{G}_r(\mathfrak{L}, L'|ID_{U'} \in Z^+_n)=1\}\\
&{\rm Pr}_a=|{\rm Pr}'_1-{\rm Pr}'_2|=|{\rm Pr}_1-{\rm Pr}_2|=\epsilon_{ECDDHP}(k)
\end{align*}

The ECDDH problem implies that in $\mathcal{G}_r$ the adversary
    cannot distinguish a user $U'$ chosen from \{${U_1}, {U_2}, \cdots, {U_v}$\}
        or randomly from the user set of UPPRESSO.
%    (indistinguishability of users to collusive RPs).
So the RP-based identity linkage is impossible.

%    the adversary will have non-negligible advantages in $\mathcal{G}$
%        and $Pr_s$ is non-negligible.

%If $s'=1$ and $ID_U' \in$\{$ID_{U_1}$, $ID_{U_2}$, ..., $ID_{U_a}$\}, the adversary succeeds in this game.
%If the adversary does not have the non-negligible probability on succeeding in this game, RP-based identity linkage is not impossible.

%We define the probability that the adversary succeeds in this game as $Pr_s'$.
%So, if the adversary is able to ,
%    the adversary will have non-negligible advantages in $\mathcal{G}$
%        and $Pr_s$ is non-negligible.


\begin{comment}
\noindent\textbf{RP-based Identity Linkage.}
We prove that UPPRESSO prevents the RP-based identity linkage,
 based on the elliptic curve decision Diffie-Hellman (ECDDH) assumption \cite{GoldwasserK16}.
%We briefly introduce the ECDDH assumption.

Let $\mathbb{E}$ be an elliptic curve over a finite field $\mathbb{F}_q$,
    and $P$ be a point on $\mathbb{E}$ of order $n$.
For any probabilistic polynomial time (PPT) algorithm $\mathcal{D}$,
 $([x]P$, $[y]P$, $[xy]P)$ and $([x]P$, $[y]P$, $[z]P)$
are computationally indistinguishable,
 where $x$, $y$ and $z$ are integer numbers randomly and independently chosen from $(1,n)$.
Let  $Pr\{\}$ denote the probability and
 we define
\begin{align*}
Pr_1 = & Pr\{\mathcal{D}(P, [x]P, [y]P, [xy]P)=1\} \\
Pr_2 = & Pr\{\mathcal{D}(P, [x]P, [y]P, [z]P)=1\} \\
\epsilon(k) = & Pr_1 - Pr_2
\end{align*}
Then, $\epsilon(k)$ becomes negligible with the security parameter $k$.

%Let $q$ be a large prime and $\mathbb{G}$ denotes a cyclic group of order $n$ of an elliptic curve $E(\mathbb{F}_q)$.
%Assume that $n$ is also a large prime. Let $P$ be a generator point of $\mathbb{G}$.

%where $q$ and $n$ are large primitive number, and $P$ is the point of $\mathbb{G}$.
%For any probabilistic polynomial time (PPT) algorithm $D$, the distributions, \{$P$, $aP$, $bP$, $abP$\}$_{a,b \in \mathbb{Z}_n}$ and \{$P$, $aP$, $bP$, $cP$\}$_{a,b,c \in \mathbb{Z}_n}$, are computationally indistinguishable. There is a negligible $\sigma(k)$, where $k$ is the security parameter.

%\end{figure*}


In the RP-based identity linkage,
    two RPs bring two triads received in SSO login instances, $\{ID_{RP_j}$, $t_j$, $[ID_U][t_j]{ID_{RP_j}}\}$ and
    $\{ID_{RP_{j'}}$, $t_{j'}$, $[ID_{U'}] [t_{j'}] {ID_{RP_{j'}}}\}$.
We describe the attack as the following game $\mathcal{G}$ between an adversary and a challenger:
    the adversary receives $\{ID_{RP_j}$, $t_j$, $[ID_U][t_j]{ID_{RP_j}}, ID_{RP_{j'}}$, $t_{j'}$, $[ID_{U'}] [t_{j'}] {ID_{RP_{j'}}}\}$ from the challenger,
     and outputs the result $s$.
The result is 1, when the adversary guesses that $ID_U = ID_{U'}$;
     otherwise, the adversary thinks they are different users (i.e., $ID_U \neq ID_{U'}$) and $s=0$.
%The game is shown as Figure \ref{fig:game}.

We define $Pr_c$ as the probability that
    the adversary outputs $s=1$ when $ID_U = ID_{U'}$ (i.e., a \emph{correct} identity linkage),
    and $Pr_{\bar{c}}$ as the probability that $s=1$ but $ID_U \neq ID_{U'}$ (i.e., an \emph{incorrect} result).
The successful RP-based identity linkage means
    the adversary has non-negligible advantages in $\mathcal{G}$.

\end{figure}

We design a PPT algorithm $\mathcal{D}^*$ based on $\mathcal{G}$, shown in Figure \ref{fig:dalgorithm}.
The input of $\mathcal{D}^*$ is in the form of $\{Q_1, Q_2, Q_3, Q_4\}$, and each $Q_i$ is a point on $\mathbb{E}$.
On receiving the input,
 the challenger of $\mathcal{G}$ randomly chooses $t_j$ and $t_{j'}$ in $(1,n)$,
   % and sets $ID_{RP_j}=Q_1$, $ID_{RP_{j'}}=Q_2$, $PID_{U,j}=[t_j]Q_3$, and $PID_{U',j'}= [t_{j'}] Q_4$.
    and sends $\{Q_1, t_j, [t_j]Q_3, Q_2, t_{j'}, [t_{j'}] Q_4\}$ to the adversary in $\mathcal{G}$.
Finally,
    it directly outputs $s$ from $\mathcal{G}$ as the result of $\mathcal{D}^*$.

Let ($P$, $[x]P$, $[y]P$, $[xy]P$) and  ($P$, $[x]P$, $[y]P$, $[z]P$) be two inputs of $\mathcal{D}^*$.
Thus, we obtain
\begin{equation}\label{eq:game-succed}
\begin{split}
&Pr\{\mathcal{D}^*(P,[x]P,[y]P,[xy]P)=1\}\\
=&Pr\{\mathcal{G}(P, t_j, [t_j][y]P, [x]P, t_{j'},[t_{j'}][xy]P)=1\}\\
=&Pr\{\mathcal{G}(P, t_j, [y][t_j]P, [x]P, t_{j'},[y][t_{j'}][x]P)=1\}=Pr_c
\end{split}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}\label{eq:game-fail}
\begin{split}
&Pr\{\mathcal{D}^*(P,[x]P,[y]P,[z]P)=1\} \\
=&Pr\{\mathcal{G}(P, t_j, [t_j][y]P, [x]P, t_{j'},[t_{j'}][z/x] [x]P)=1\}\\
=&Pr\{\mathcal{G}(P, t_j, [y][t_j]P, [x]P, t_{j'},[z/x][t_{j'}][x]P)=1\}=Pr_{\bar{c}}
\end{split}
\end{equation}
Equation \ref{eq:game-succed} is equal to $Pr_c$
        because it represents the correct case of $ID_{U} = ID_{U'} = y$,
 while Equation \ref{eq:game-fail} is $Pr_{\bar{c}}$ for it represents the incorrect case of $ID_{U} =y$ but $ID_{U'} = z/x \bmod n$.


The adversary has non-negligible advantages in $\mathcal{G}$ means
    $Pr_c - Pr_{\bar{c}}$ is non-negligible,
    and then $\mathcal{D}^*$ significantly distinguishes ($P$, $[x]P$, $[y]P$, $[xy]P$) from  ($P$, $[x]P$, $[y]P$, $[z]P$),
    which violates the ECDDH assumption.
So the adversary has no advantages in the game,
    and the RP-based identity linkage is computationally impossible in UPPRESSO.
