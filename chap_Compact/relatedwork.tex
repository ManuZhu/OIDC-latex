%Various SSO services have been designed, implemented and investigated for several years.

%Various SSO protocols have been proposed, such as OIDC, SAML, OAuth 2.0, Central Authentication Service \cite{aubry2004esup} and Kerberos \cite{Kerberos}.
%These protocols are widely adopted in Google, Facebook, Shibboleth project \cite{Shibboleth}, Java applications, etc.
%And, plenty of works have been conducted on privacy protection and security analysis for SSO systems.

%\subsection{Privacy protection for SSO systems.}

%\noindent\textbf{Privacy-preserving SSO systems.}
%%在描述Privacy-preserving SSO systems的内容中，是否需要原文中的以下内容：
%%1.BrowserID的安全问题 2.我们方案的优点
%%Privacy problems in SSO have been widely recognized that, as suggested in NIST SP800-63C \cite{NIST2017draft}, SSO systems should prevent both RP-based identity linkage and IdP-based login tracing. However, only a few solutions were proposed to protect user privacy so far. The pairwise user identifier, a simple design of function $\mathcal{F}_{ID_{U} \mapsto PID_{U}}$, has been specified in widely adopted deployed SSO standards, such as SAML \cite{SAML} and OIDC \cite{OpenIDConnect}. However, pairwise user identifier cannot prevent the IdP-based login tracing attack, as it doesn't adopt the function $\mathcal{F}_{ID_{RP} \mapsto PID_{RP}}$, therefore exposing $ID_{RP}$ to RP directly. To best of our knowledge, so far only SPRESSO \cite{SPRESSO} and BrowserID \cite{BrowserID} are proposed to prevent RP-based identity linkage by designing the individual function $\mathcal{F}_{ID_{RP} \mapsto PID_{RP}}$. However, neither SPRESSO nor BrowserID have proposed the function $\mathcal{F}_{ID_{U} \mapsto PID_{U}}$, which makes they are vulnerable to IdP-based login tracing. Moreover, there is no simple way to combine the existing function $\mathcal{F}_{ID_{U} \mapsto PID_{U}}$ and $\mathcal{F}_{ID_{RP} \mapsto PID_{RP}}$, as the dilemma is discussed in Section \ref{**} which breaks the \textbf{user identification} in SSO system.
%As suggested by NIST \cite{NIST2017draft}, SSO systems should prevent both  RP-based identity linkage and IdP-based login tracing.
%The pairwise user identifier is adopted in SAML \cite{SAMLIdentifier} and OIDC \cite{OpenIDConnect}, and only prevents RP--based identity linkage; while SPRESSO \cite{SPRESSO} and BrowserID \cite{BrowserID} only prevent  IdP-based login tracing.
%BrowserID is adopted in Persona \cite{persona} and Firefox Accounts \cite{FirefoxAccount}, however an analysis on Persona found IdP-based login tracing could still succeed \cite{FettKS14, BrowserID}.
%UPPRESSO prevents both the RP-based identity linkage and IdP-based login tracing and could be integrated into OIDC which has been formally analyzed \cite{FettKS17}.
%%Moreover, OAuth and OIDC allow users to determine the scope of attributes exposed to the RP.

\vspace{1mm}
\noindent\textbf{Formal Analysis on SSO Protocols.}
%The SSO standards (e.g., SAML, OAuth, and OIDC) have been formally analyzed.
Fett et al. \cite{FettKS16, FettKS17} formally analyze OAuth 2.0 and OIDC based on an expressive Dolev-Yao model \cite{FettKS14},
    and presented two attacks, i.e., 307 redirect and IdP mix-up attacks.
When the IdP misuses an HTTP 307 status code for redirection, the sensitive information (e.g., credentials) entered at the IdP
    will  be leaked to the RP through  the user's browser.
The IdP mix-up attack confuses the RP about which IdP is used and the victim RP sends the token to a malicious IdP,
 which breaks the confidentiality of identity tokens.
According to these formal proofs \cite{FettKS16, FettKS17},
    OAuth 2.0 and OIDC are secure except these two attacks.
%UPPRESSO could be integrated into OIDC, which simplifies its security analysis.
SAML 2.0 SSO is formally analyzed \cite{ArmandoCCCT08},
    and the RP identity is found not to be bound correctly in the identity tokens of its variant proposed by Google.





\vspace{1mm}
\noindent\textbf{Vulnerabilities of SSO Implementations.}
Various vulnerabilities were found in SSO implementations,
    and then exploited to launch impersonation and identity injection attacks
     by breaking the confidentiality \cite{WangCW12,ccsSunB12,ArmandoCCCPS13,DiscoveringJCS,dimvaLiM16}, integrity \cite{WangCW12,SomorovskyMSKJ12,WangZLG16,MainkaMS16, MainkaMSW17,dimvaLiM16} or RP designation \cite{WangZLG16,MainkaMS16,MainkaMSW17,YangLCZ18,dimvaLiM16} of identity tokens.
Wang et al. \cite{WangCW12} analyzed the SSO services of Google and Facebook from the view of browser-relayed traffics
    and found logic flaws in the IdPs and RPs to break the confidentiality and integrity of identity tokens.
The integrity of identity tokens was destroyed in SAML, OAuth and OIDC systems  \cite{SomorovskyMSKJ12,WangCW12,WangZLG16,MainkaMS16, MainkaMSW17},
due to software flaws, such as XML signature wrapping (XSW) \cite{SomorovskyMSKJ12}, incomplete verification by RPs \cite{WangCW12,WangZLG16,MainkaMSW17}, and IdP spoofing \cite{MainkaMS16,MainkaMSW17}.
Vulnerabilities also break the RP designation of tokens,
    such as incorrect binding at IdPs \cite{YangLCZ18,WangZLG16} and insufficient verification by RPs \cite{MainkaMS16,MainkaMSW17,YangLCZ18}.
Navas et al. \cite{NavasB19} indicate the impactive threats on OIDC security and privacy.
Automatical tools, such as SSOScan \cite{ZhouE14}, OAuthTester \cite{YangLLZH16} and S3KVetter \cite{YangLCZ18},
 are designed to detect the violations of confidentiality, integrity, or RP designation in identity tokens.
 Wang et al. \cite{ExplicatingSDK} propose the scheme, that combines manual effort and automated
verification.
%Besides, a flaw was found in Google Apps \cite{ArmandoCCCPS13}, allowing a malicious RP to hijack a user's authentication attempt and inject a payload to steal the cookie (or identity token) for another RP.


%1.	WebSSO中有browser来完成，2. Mobile SSO中，system browser和webview无法识别RP、IdP App可能被重打包。
In mobile SSO systems, the IdP App, IdP-provided SDK (e.g., an encapsulated WebView) or system browser are adopted to redirect identity token from IdP App to RP App.
However, none of them was trusted to ensure that the identity token could be only sent to the designated RP \cite{ChenPCTKT14,WangZLLYLG15}, as WebView and  system browser cannot authenticate RP App while the IdP App may be repackaged.
Moreover, the SSO protocols needed to be modified to provide SSO services for mobile Apps, however these modifications were not well understood by RP developers \cite{ChenPCTKT14,YangLS17}.
The top Android applications have been analyzed \cite{TowardsShehabM14,ChenPCTKT14,WangZLLYLG15,YangLS17,ShiWL19}, and vulnerabilities were found to break the confidentiality \cite{TowardsShehabM14,ChenPCTKT14,WangZLLYLG15,YangLS17,ShiWL19}, integrity \cite{ChenPCTKT14,YangLS17}, and RP designation \cite{ChenPCTKT14,ShiWL19} of identity token.
Besides, a flaw was found in Google Apps \cite{ArmandoCCCPS13}, allowing a malicious RP to hijack a user's authentication attempt and inject a payload to steal the cookie (or identity token) for another RP.

\vspace{1mm}
\noindent\textbf{Single Sign-Off.} In SSO systems, once a user's IdP account is compromised, the adversary could hijack all her RPs' accounts.
A backwards-compatible extension, named single sign-off, is proposed for OIDC.
The single sign-off  allows the user to revoke all her identity tokens and notify all RPs to freeze her accounts \cite{GhasemisharifRC18}.
This single sign-off can also be achieved in UPPRESSO,
    where the user needs to revoke the identity tokens at all RPs,
     as the IdP doesn't know which RPs the user visits.

%analysis of 14 major SAML frameworks and show that 11 of them, including Salesforce, Shibboleth, and IBM XS40, have critical XML Signature wrapping (XSW) vulnerabilities
XML Signature wrapping (XSW) vulnerabilities were found in 11 major SAML implementations (e.g., the ones provided by Salesforce, Shibboleth, and IBM XS40) \cite{SomorovskyMSKJ12}, which was used to break the integrity of identity token.
%Juraj et al.\cite{SomorovskyMSKJ12} breaks the integrity, by exploiting the XSW vulnerabilities to  insert malicious elements in 11 SAML frameworks.
Wang et al. \cite{WangCW12} performed a traffic analysis on SSO implementations provided by Google and Facebook, and broke the integrity and confidentiality to sign onto the victim's account.

%In 2014 Zhou et al. \cite{ZhouE14}, in 2016 Wang et al. \cite{WangZLG16} and Yang et al. \cite{YangLLZH16} built the automatic tester to analyse the implementations of existing applications and achieve the statistical result of these applications.
%The usual vulnerabilities found in these works includes, 1) using bearer token for authentication (break binding); 2) using publicly accessible information as identity token (breaking confidentiality); 3) client-side protocol logic (breaking integrity) and so on.
The vulnerabilities \cite{ZhouE14,WangZLG16,YangLLZH16} were found in the RP's implementations of OAuth, for example, the bearer token or publicly accessible information is misused as the identity token which allows the breaking of binding or confidentiality, the incomplete verification at the client breaks the integrity.
%MainkaMS16 针对OpenID，描述的是恶意的IdP影响到RP集成的其他正确IdP上的用户信息，主要是 ID Spoofing: 恶意的IdP以正确的IdP名义签发identity token；Key Confusion 让RP 以为恶意IdP的key是对应正确IdP的。
%We found two novel classes of attacks, ID Spoofing (IDS) and Key Confusion (KC), on OpenID, which were not covered by previous research. Both attack classes allow compromising the security of all accounts on a vulnerable SP, even if those accounts were not allowed to use the malicious IdP.

%Christian et al. \cite{MainkaMS16, MainkaMSW17} proposed the corrupted IdP might compromise the account in the RP associated with other IdPs, which break the confidentiality and integrity of SSO systems.
%ArmandoCCCPS13 针对SAML和OpenID，攻击者利用浏览器的漏洞，将用户与RP之间的cookie发送给了恶意的RP，破坏机密性。具体地，就是讲恶意的js代码插在relaystate参数中，破坏同源策略。
%As we can see in the figure, c requires a resource from a compromised SP i; i, acting in turn as a client, receives from sp an Authentication Request, and passes it back to c, with the malicious code injected into theRelayState. The client’s browser eventually executes the redirection to the maliciously-crafted URI, as if coming from the Google domain (thus circumventing the same origin policy). This redirection leads to the theft of theHID, HUSR, and ASIDAScookies by sp.

\noindent\textbf{Anonymous SSO Systems.}
Anonymous SSO schemes are designed to allow users to access a service (i.e. RP) protected by the IdP,
    without revealing their identities.
Anonymous SSO was proposed for the global system for mobile (GSM) communications \cite{ElmuftiWRR08},
    and the notion of anonymous SSO was formalized \cite{WangWS13}.
Privacy-preserving primitives, such as group signature, zero-knowledge proof, Chebyshev Chaotic Maps and proxy re-verification, etc.,
     were adopted to design anonymous SSO systems \cite{WangWS13,HanCSTW18,Lee18,HanCSTWW20}.
%However, all above schemes cannot provide either the $ID_{U}$ directly or the function $\mathcal{F}_{ID_{U} \mapsto PID_{U}}$ and $\mathcal{F}_{PID_{U} \mapsto Account}$ allowing RP achieve the constant $Account$ for the same user. It breaks the basic requirement of \textbf{user identification}.
Anonymous SSO schemes work for special applications,
    but are unapplicable to common systems that require user identification for customized services.

\vspace{1mm}
\noindent\textbf{Privacy-preserving authentication with user-maintained proof.}
There is another thought to allow a user to achieve the convenient authentication without exposing her traceable identity to any parties,
 by maintaining the authentication proof herself.
For example, FIDO \cite{fidouaf} allows a user to generate the asymmetric key pair on her device and register the public key at an RP, so that the user can login to this RP with a challenge signed using the private key. Other schemes, such as El passo \cite{ZhangKSZR21} and UnlimitID \cite{IsaakidisHD16}, enable user to keep a secret
s and require IdP to generate an identity proof for blinded s. Thus the user can prove that she is the owner of s to RP without exposing s to RP.
However, there are still flaws in these systems.
FIDO is only available on the qualified device with the support of FIDO secure hardware.
In the El passo and UnlimitID systems, the user's identity is associated with the private s, therefore, if the user wants to login to the RP on a new device, she must import the large s into this device.
As for the secure consideration, the secret must too large to remember, so that the solutions are not convenient for multi-device login.
