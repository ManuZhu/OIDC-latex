\noindent\textbf{Privacy-preserving cryptographic technique.}
PrivacyPass and TrustToken \cite{privacypass,trusttoken} propose anonymous tokens for applications that grant anonymous access to authorized users. They used a cryptographic technique that was originally designed for oblivious pseudorandom functions (OPRFs) \cite{oprf-proved,voprf-proved}.
A user generates a random number $e_i$ for each unsigned token $T_i$ and blinds $T_i$ into $T_i^{e_i}$. After the user is authenticated, a token server signs ($T_i^{e_i}, T_i^{e_i k}$) with a private key $k$. Then, the user converts $T_i^{e_i k}$ to $T_i^k$ using $e_i$ and redeems the token ($T_i, T_i^k$) to access resources.
%the token server blindly binds user-selected secrets $t_i$ and access tokens ($T_i, T_i^{k{r_i}}$) and signs them with its secret key $k$, where $T_i=H(t_i)$ and $H$ is a hash function.
%The user unblinds them to obtain anonymous tokens ($t_i, T_i^k$) and redeems them later on the service.
%The random numbers (or blinding factors) prevent the token server from linking token signing and redemption.
Anonymous tokens may be used to build anonymous SSO services, where an RP does not identify each user.
% they can be used to implement anonymous SSO services that are secure against IdP-based tracing and RP-based linkage.}
%\textcolor{blue}{They provide SSO services that are fundamentally different from the ones offered by UPPRESSO. As shown in Table~\ref{tbl:comparison-protocol}, they lack support for all three SSO features. First, the anonymous tokens used by different users or by the same user in different logins cannot be distinguished (i.e., no user identification at RPs), since they are signed blindly using the same server secret. Besides, the users are required to maintain anonymous tokens for asynchronous authentication in addition to the credentials for the IdP, similar to other privacy-preserving solutions based on anonymous credentials. Finally, PrivacyPass and TrustToken do not support selective user attribution provisioning. In contrast, UPPRESSO formalizes the privacy-preserving SSO process as two ID-transformation problems and generates unlinkable pseudoidentities and proofs to support the desired SSO features. Therefore,  UPPRESSO is  compatible with widely-adopted SSO protocols such as OIDC and SAML.}
%\textcolor{blue}{PrivacyPass and TrustToken allow a user to receive tokens \cite{privacypass,trusttoken}, each of which is denoted as ($T, T^{k}$), where $k$ is the token server's private key. These tokens are used to access resources anonymously in the future. To unlink token signing and redemption, a user generates a random number $e$ for each token, blinds $T$ into $T^{e}$, and sends it to request ($T^e, T^{ek}$) from the token server. The user then utilizes $e$ to obtain $T^k$ from $T^{ek}$, and then only ($T, T^{k}$) is redeemed to access resources. This cryptographic skill \cite{oprf-proved} is used in UPPRESSO similarly: a user transforms $ID_{RP}$ to $PID_{RP} = [t]ID_{RP}$ by a random number $t$, and $PID_{RP}$ is transformed again by an IdP to $[tu]ID_{RP}$. The visited RP calculates $Acct = [u]ID_{RP}$ from $[tu]ID_{RP}$ by using $t$ (see Table \ref{tbl:notations-protocol} for detailed descriptions of these notations).}
In \usso, the identity transformations are implemented using a similar cryptographic technique. In particular, a user first transforms $ID_{RP}$ to $PID_{RP} = [t]ID_{RP}$ using a random number $t$, and then the IdP transforms $PID_{RP}$ further to $[ut]ID_{RP}$. The visited RP finally calculates $Acct = [u]ID_{RP}$ from $[ut]ID_{RP}$ by using $t$.
 %(see Table \ref{tbl:notations-protocol} for detailed descriptions of these notations).
% \textcolor{blue}{UPPRESSO differs from PrivacyPass and TrustToken as below.
% Firstly, PrivacyPass and TrustToken work as anonymous SSO to some extent, where one consistent private key serves all users, but UPPRESSO identifies each user at an RP. Secondly, the above cryptographic skill \cite{oprf-proved} is differently utilized. UPPRESSO integrates it to transform identities in SSO:
Here, \usso~supports the IdP-untraceability property that prevents the IdP from linking $ID_{RP}$ and a corresponding $[t]ID_{RP}$. %leveraging the ECDLP assumption (see Section~\ref{sec-:analysis}).
 This is similar to the unlinkability between token signing and redemption in PrivacyPass/TrustToken, which prevents the server from linking ($T_i^{e_i}, T_i^{e_ik}$) and  ($T_i, T_i^k$). %leveraging the DLP assumption. %The unlinkability between token signing and redemption, or ($T_i^{e_i}, T_i^{e_ik}$) and  ($T_i, T_i^k$), roughly corresponds to only the IdP-untraceability in UPPRESSO: an IdP cannot link any pair of $[t_i]ID_{RP}$ and $ID_{RP}$.  % $i = 1, 2, \cdots$. % which fundamentally depends on the ECDLP assumption.

However, \usso~explores this cryptographic technique %with different designs and
in greater depth, resulting in an additional privacy property that is not considered or supported in existing anonymous tokens \cite{privacypass,trusttoken}. %or OPRFs \cite{oprf-proved,voprf-proved}
The exponent $k$ in PrivacyPass/TrustToken is held only by the server as a private key, and the random number $e$ is only known to a user. In contrast, the scalar $u$ in \usso~denotes a user identity known to the user and the IdP, while the random number $t$ is an ephemeral trapdoor shared between the user and the RP.
%The application of the cryptographic technique differs from PrivacyPass/TrustToken
%This different design allows \usso~to explore and offer additional privacy properties. %Furthermore, more privacy properties are explored in UPPRESSO.
The sharing of random numbers enables the derivation of permanent accounts,
 while additional unlinkability across colluding RPs is supported. Their knowledge about two different users $u$ and $u'$, i.e., ($ID_{RP}, t, [u]ID_{RP}$) and ($ID_{RP'}, t', [u']ID_{RP'}$), obtained from different logins, are indistinguishable.
%given multiple users, e.g., identified as $u$ and $u'$, ($ID_{RP}, t, [u]ID_{RP}$) and ($ID_{RP'}, t', [u']ID_{RP'}$) are indistinguishable to colluding RPs.
%This property requires designing the identity transformations under not only ECDLP but also ECDDH assumptions (see Section~\ref{sec-:analysis}).

% \noindent\textbf{Anonymous SSO.}
% Such schemes allow authenticated users to access a service protected by an IdP,
%     without revealing their identities.
% Anonymous SSO was proposed for GSM communications \cite{ElmuftiWRR08},
%     and formalized \cite{WangWS13}.
% Privacy-preserving primitives, such as group signature, zero-knowledge proof, Chebyshev Chaotic Maps and proxy re-verification,
%      were adopted to design anonymous SSO \cite{WangWS13,HanCSTW18,Lee18,HanCSTWW20}.
% Anonymous SSO schemes work for some special applications,
%     but are unapplicable in most systems that require user identification for customized services.

\oldc
Cryptographic primitives are used for protecting user privacy.
Using zero-knowledge proofs, ZKlaims \cite{zklaim} allows users to prove statements on the credentials issued by a trusted server without revealing the credential contents.
Crypto-Book \cite{crypto-book} adopts distributed key generation to generate linkable-ring-signature private keys for users, and each key pair is used as an untraceable pseudonym. Tandem \cite{tandem} generates one-time-use key-share tokens for a two-party threshold cryptographic scheme implemented with a central server, to protect the privacy of key-usage patterns.


%two-party threshold cryptographic scheme implemented with a central server, to protect user private keys \cite{mRSA,ss-rsa}: to sign/decrypt a message, a user needs a token from the server.
%    Tandem \cite{tandem} decouples the obtaining and using of such tokens, for the privacy of key usage.

\noindent\textbf{Formal analysis of SSO protocols.}
A formal analysis on SAML-based SSO \cite{ArmandoCCCT08} found that a Google-implemented variant does not bind RP identities correctly in the identity tokens.
Fett et al. \cite{FettKS16, FettKS17} formally analyzed OIDC and OAuth 2.0 using a Dolev-Yao-style model \cite{FettKS14} and reported the 307 redirection and IdP mix-up attacks.
In this paper, we also developed a Dolev-Yao-style model for \usso, helping to prove its security and privacy (see Section~\ref{dy-model}).

\noindent\textbf{Implementation vulnerabilities in SSO.}
Various vulnerabilities have been found in several SSO systems for web applications, resulting in attacks %of impersonation and identity injection
that break the confidentiality \cite{WangCW12,ccsSunB12,ArmandoCCCPS13,DiscoveringJCS,dimvaLiM16}, integrity \cite{WangCW12,SomorovskyMSKJ12,WangZLG16,MainkaMS16, MainkaMSW17,dimvaLiM16} or RP designation \cite{WangZLG16,MainkaMS16,MainkaMSW17,YangLCZ18,dimvaLiM16} of identity tokens.
%In the SSO services of Google and Facebook, %from the view of browser-relayed traffics
%    logic flaws of the IdPs and RPs were detected \cite{WangCW12}.  % to break the confidentiality and integrity of identity tokens.
The integrity of identity tokens was violated %\cite{SomorovskyMSKJ12,WangCW12,WangZLG16,MainkaMS16, MainkaMSW17}
due to software flaws such as defective verification by RPs \cite{WangCW12,WangZLG16,MainkaMSW17}, XML signature wrapping \cite{SomorovskyMSKJ12}, and IdP spoofing \cite{MainkaMS16,MainkaMSW17}.
Meanwhile, the RP designation was broken because of incorrect binding by an IdP \cite{YangLCZ18,WangZLG16} or insufficient verification by RPs \cite{MainkaMS16,MainkaMSW17,YangLCZ18}.
A defective IdP does not always enclose an identifiable Email address in tokens \cite{WangCW12},
 which breaks the user identification.
Similar vulnerabilities have been found in Android Apps that break the confidentiality \cite{ChenPCTKT14,WangZLLYLG15,YangLS17,ShiWL19}, integrity \cite{ChenPCTKT14,YangLS17}, and RP designation \cite{ChenPCTKT14,ShiWL19,WangZLLYLG15} of SSO identity tokens.

%Navas et al. \cite{NavasB19} discussed the possible attack patterns against OIDC services.
%Automatic tools such as SSOScan \cite{ZhouE14}, OAuthTester \cite{YangLLZH16} and S3KVetter \cite{YangLCZ18},
% detect the violations of confidentiality, integrity, or RP designation of SSO identity tokens.
% Wang et al. \cite{ExplicatingSDK} detect the vulnerable applications
%     built with authentication/authorization SDKs,
%      due to the implicit but unsuitable assumptions of these SDKs.


%Furthermore, if a user is compromised, the attacker can login to RPs on his behalf. So, we consider malicious users, malicious RPs, and colluding users and RPs in our threat model (see Section~\ref{subsec:threatmodel}).





% In a mobile system,
% browsers, IdP Apps,
%     or IdP-provided SDKs %(e.g., an encapsulated WebView)
%          are responsible for forwarding identity tokens, %from the IdP App to RP Apps.
% but none of them ensures an identity token is sent to the designated RP only \cite{ChenPCTKT14,WangZLLYLG15}.
% %    because a WebView or the system browser cannot authenticate the RP Apps and the IdP App may be repackaged.
% %SSO protocols are modified for mobile Apps, but the modifications are not well understood by developers \cite{ChenPCTKT14,YangLS17}.
% Vulnerabilities were found in Android Apps,
%     to break confidentiality \cite{ChenPCTKT14,WangZLLYLG15,YangLS17,ShiWL19}, integrity \cite{ChenPCTKT14,YangLS17}, and RP designation \cite{ChenPCTKT14,ShiWL19} of identity tokens.
% A flaw was found in Google Apps \cite{ArmandoCCCPS13}, allowing a malicious RP to hijack a user's authentication attempt and inject a payload to steal the cookie or identity token belonging to another RP.

% If a user is compromised,
%     attackers will login to RPs on behalf of him.
% Single sign-off helps the victim user
%  to revoke all his tokens accepted and logout from the RPs  \cite{GhasemisharifRC18}.
% FedCM \cite{FedCM} attempts to disable iframe and third-party cookies in SSO, which could be exploited to track users.
% %UPRRSSO protects privacy in SSO through ID transformations and our prototype does NOT use either iframe or third-party cookies.
