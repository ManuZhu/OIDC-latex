%Various SSO services have been designed, implemented and investigated for several years.

%Various SSO protocols have been proposed, such as OIDC, SAML, OAuth 2.0, Central Authentication Service \cite{aubry2004esup} and Kerberos \cite{Kerberos}.
%These protocols are widely adopted in Google, Facebook, Shibboleth project \cite{Shibboleth}, Java applications, etc.
%And, plenty of works have been conducted on privacy protection and security analysis for SSO systems.

%\subsection{Privacy protection for SSO systems.}

%\noindent\textbf{Privacy-preserving SSO systems.}
%%在描述Privacy-preserving SSO systems的内容中，是否需要原文中的以下内容：
%%1.BrowserID的安全问题 2.我们方案的优点
%%Privacy problems in SSO have been widely recognized that, as suggested in NIST SP800-63C \cite{NIST2017draft}, SSO systems should prevent both RP-based identity linkage and IdP-based login tracing. However, only a few solutions were proposed to protect user privacy so far. The pairwise user identifier, a simple design of function $\mathcal{F}_{ID_{U} \mapsto PID_{U}}$, has been specified in widely adopted deployed SSO standards, such as SAML \cite{SAML} and OIDC \cite{OpenIDConnect}. However, pairwise user identifier cannot prevent the IdP-based login tracing attack, as it doesn't adopt the function $\mathcal{F}_{ID_{RP} \mapsto PID_{RP}}$, therefore exposing $ID_{RP}$ to RP directly. To best of our knowledge, so far only SPRESSO \cite{SPRESSO} and BrowserID \cite{BrowserID} are proposed to prevent RP-based identity linkage by designing the individual function $\mathcal{F}_{ID_{RP} \mapsto PID_{RP}}$. However, neither SPRESSO nor BrowserID have proposed the function $\mathcal{F}_{ID_{U} \mapsto PID_{U}}$, which makes they are vulnerable to IdP-based login tracing. Moreover, there is no simple way to combine the existing function $\mathcal{F}_{ID_{U} \mapsto PID_{U}}$ and $\mathcal{F}_{ID_{RP} \mapsto PID_{RP}}$, as the dilemma is discussed in Section \ref{**} which breaks the \textbf{user identification} in SSO system.
%As suggested by NIST \cite{NIST2017draft}, SSO systems should prevent both  RP-based identity linkage and IdP-based login tracing.
%The pairwise user identifier is adopted in SAML \cite{SAMLIdentifier} and OIDC \cite{OpenIDConnect}, and only prevents RP--based identity linkage; while SPRESSO \cite{SPRESSO} and BrowserID \cite{BrowserID} only prevent  IdP-based login tracing.
%BrowserID is adopted in Persona \cite{persona} and Firefox Accounts \cite{FirefoxAccount}, however an analysis on Persona found IdP-based login tracing could still succeed \cite{FettKS14, BrowserID}.
%UPPRESSO prevents both the RP-based identity linkage and IdP-based login tracing and could be integrated into OIDC which has been formally analyzed \cite{FettKS17}.
%%Moreover, OAuth and OIDC allow users to determine the scope of attributes exposed to the RP.

\noindent\textbf{Privacy-Preserving Token or Credential.}
%Such tokens (or credentials) authorize a user to conduct operations
%        in privacy-preserving ways.
%
%    tokens (or credentials) authorize a user to conduct operations
%        in privacy-preserving ways.
In addition to sign-on, privacy-enhancing technologies have been applied in various scenarios,
  but not adopted to comprehensively transform the five (pseudo-)identities in SSO services.
PrivacyPass and TrustToken \cite{privacypass,trusttoken} allow a user to receive a great number of \emph{anonymous} tokens.
 These tokens are used to access resources on content delivery networks,
    so a user does not interact with challenges such as CAPTCHAs.
ZKlaims \cite{zklaim} allow users to prove statements on the credentials issued by a trusted party
    using zero-knowledge proofs,
        but the credential contents are not revealed.
Crypto-Book \cite{crypto-book} coordinates servers to generate a ring-signature private key,
 and a user picks up his private key through a list of Email addresses (i.e., an anonymity set).
 Then the key pair works as an untraceable pseudonym to sign messages.
Two-party threshold schemes are implemented with a central server,
    to protect user private keys \cite{mRSA,ss-rsa}:
    to sign or decrypt a message, a user needs a token from the server.
    Tandem \cite{tandem} decouples the obtaining and using of such tokens,
for the privacy of key usage.


%\vspace{0.5mm}
\noindent\textbf{Anonymous SSO.}
Such schemes allow authenticated users to access a service protected by an IdP,
    without revealing their identities.
Anonymous SSO was proposed for GSM communications \cite{ElmuftiWRR08},
    and formalized \cite{WangWS13}.
Privacy-preserving primitives, such as group signature, zero-knowledge proof, Chebyshev Chaotic Maps and proxy re-verification,
     were adopted to design anonymous SSO \cite{WangWS13,HanCSTW18,Lee18,HanCSTWW20}.
Anonymous SSO schemes work for some applications,
    but are \emph{unapplicable} to most systems that require user identification for customized services.

%\vspace{0.5mm}
\noindent\textbf{Formal Analysis on SSO Protocols.}
%The SSO standards (e.g., SAML, OAuth, and OIDC) have been formally analyzed.
Fett et al. \cite{FettKS16, FettKS17} formally analyzed OAuth 2.0 and OIDC using a Dolev-Yao style model \cite{FettKS14},
    and presented the attacks of 307 redirection and IdP mix-up.
        %When the IdP misuses an HTTP 307 status code for redirection, the sensitive information (e.g., credentials) entered at the IdP
         %   will  be leaked to the RP through  the user's browser.
        %The IdP mix-up attack confuses the RP about which IdP is used and the victim RP sends the token to a malicious IdP,
        % which breaks the confidentiality of identity tokens.
%According to these formal proofs \cite{FettKS16, FettKS17},
%    OAuth 2.0 and OIDC are secure except these two attacks.
%UPPRESSO could be integrated into OIDC, which simplifies its security analysis.
SAML-based SSO is also analyzed \cite{ArmandoCCCT08},
    and it is found that RP identities are not correctly bound in the identity tokens of a variant designed by Google.



%\vspace{0.5mm}
\noindent\textbf{SSO Implementation Vulnerabilities.}
Vulnerabilities were found in SSO implementations for web applications,
    resulting in effective attacks %of impersonation and identity injection
     by breaking confidentiality \cite{WangCW12,ccsSunB12,ArmandoCCCPS13,DiscoveringJCS,dimvaLiM16}, integrity \cite{WangCW12,SomorovskyMSKJ12,WangZLG16,MainkaMS16, MainkaMSW17,dimvaLiM16} or RP designation \cite{WangZLG16,MainkaMS16,MainkaMSW17,YangLCZ18,dimvaLiM16} of identity tokens.
%In the SSO services of Google and Facebook, %from the view of browser-relayed traffics
%    logic flaws of the IdPs and RPs were detected \cite{WangCW12}.  % to break the confidentiality and integrity of identity tokens.
Integrity of identity tokens was violated in SSO systems  %\cite{SomorovskyMSKJ12,WangCW12,WangZLG16,MainkaMS16, MainkaMSW17}
due to software flaws such as
 defective verification by RPs \cite{WangCW12,WangZLG16,MainkaMSW17}, XML signature wrapping \cite{SomorovskyMSKJ12}, and IdP spoofing \cite{MainkaMS16,MainkaMSW17}.
RP designation is broken
    for incorrect binding by an IdP \cite{YangLCZ18,WangZLG16} or insufficient verification by RPs \cite{MainkaMS16,MainkaMSW17,YangLCZ18}.

Automatic tools such as SSOScan \cite{ZhouE14}, OAuthTester \cite{YangLLZH16} and S3KVetter \cite{YangLCZ18},
detect the violations of confidentiality, integrity, or RP designation of SSO identity tokens.
Wang et al. \cite{ExplicatingSDK} detect the vulnerable applications
    built with authentication/authorization SDKs,
     due to the implicit assumptions of these SDKs.
Navas et al. \cite{NavasB19} discussed the possible attack patterns against OIDC services.

In a mobile system,
browsers, IdP Apps,
    or IdP-provided SDKs %(e.g., an encapsulated WebView)
         are responsible for forwarding identity tokens, %from the IdP App to RP Apps.
but none of them ensures an identity token is sent to the designated RP only \cite{ChenPCTKT14,WangZLLYLG15}.
%    because a WebView or the system browser cannot authenticate the RP Apps and the IdP App may be repackaged.
%SSO protocols are modified for mobile Apps, but the modifications are not well understood by developers \cite{ChenPCTKT14,YangLS17}.
Vulnerabilities were found in Android Apps,
    to break confidentiality \cite{ChenPCTKT14,WangZLLYLG15,YangLS17,ShiWL19}, integrity \cite{ChenPCTKT14,YangLS17}, and RP designation \cite{ChenPCTKT14,ShiWL19} of identity tokens.
A flaw was found in Google Apps \cite{ArmandoCCCPS13}, allowing a malicious RP to hijack a user's authentication attempt and inject a payload to steal the cookie or identity token for another RP.

If a user is compromised,
    attackers will login to RPs on behalf of him.
Single sign-off \cite{GhasemisharifRC18} helps the victim
 to revoke all his tokens accepted and logout from the RPs.
