\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}
This paper proposes UPPRESSO, an untraceable and unlinkable privacy-preserving single sign-on system,
 to protect a user's login activities at different RPs against both the curious IdP and collusive RPs.
%To the best of our knowledge,
% UPPRESSO is the first practical SSO approach
%    that defends against both the privacy threats of IdP-based login tracing and RP-based identity linkage.
We convert the identity dilemma in privacy-preserving SSO into an identity-transformation challenge
 and design three functions satisfying the requirements,
 where (\emph{a}) $\mathcal{F}_{PID_{RP}}$ protects the RP's identity from the curious IdP,
(\emph{b})  $\mathcal{F}_{PID_{U}}$ prevents collusive RPs from linking a user across these RPs,
 and (\emph{c}) $\mathcal{F}_{Acct}$ allows the RP to derive an identical account for a user in his multiple login instances.
These functions can be integrated with existing SSO protocols,
    such as OIDC,
    to protect user privacy,
    without breaking the security guarantees of SSO services.
The experimental evaluation of the UPPRESSO prototype shows
 that it provides efficient SSO services:
  on average a login instance takes 174 ms (when the IdP, the RP and a user are deployed together) or 421 ms (when the user visits remotely).
