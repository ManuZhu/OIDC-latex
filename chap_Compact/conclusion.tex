\label{sec:conclusion}
In this paper, we propose an unlinkable privacy-preserving single sign-on system, named UPPRESSO, which, for the first time, protects a user's activity profile of RP visits from both the curious IdP and the collusive RPs.
UPPRESSO provides three functions, $\mathcal{F}_{ID_{RP} \mapsto PID_{RP}}$ to prevent curious IdP from obtaining the identifer of the visiting RP,
 $\mathcal{F}_{ID_{U} \mapsto PID_{U}}$ to prevent collusive RPs from linking a user, and $\mathcal{F}_{PID_{U} \mapsto Account}$ allowing each RP to derive a unchanged account for a user's multiple logins. 
These three functions could be integrated into existing SSO protocols, such as OIDC, to protect the user's privacy, without degrading the security.
Moreover, these functions are efficient, the evaluation demonstrates it takes only 254 ms for a user to log into an RP.
