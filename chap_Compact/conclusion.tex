\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}
This paper proposes UPPRESSO, an untraceable and unlinkable privacy-preserving single sign-on system,
 to protect a user's login activities at different RPs against both the curious IdP and collusive RPs.
%To the best of our knowledge,
% UPPRESSO is the first practical SSO approach
%    that defends against both the privacy threats of IdP-based login tracing and RP-based identity linkage.
We convert the identity dilemma in privacy-preserving SSO services into an identity-transformation challenge
 and design three functions satisfying the requirements,
 where (\emph{a}) $\mathcal{F}_{PID_{RP}}$ protects the RP's identity from the curious IdP,
(\emph{b})  $\mathcal{F}_{PID_{U}}$ prevents collusive RPs from linking a user based on his identities at these RPs,
 and (\emph{c}) $\mathcal{F}_{Acct}$ allows the RP to derive an identical account for a user in his multiple login instances.
These functions can be integrated with existing SSO protocols,
    such as OIDC,
    to protect user privacy,
    without breaking the security guarantees of SSO services.
The experimental evaluation of the UPPRESSO prototype demonstrates
 that it provides efficient SSO services, \textcolor[rgb]{1,0,0}{where a login instance takes only 310 ms on average}.
