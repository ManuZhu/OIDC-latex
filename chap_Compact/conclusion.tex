\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}
We propose UPPRESSO, an untraceable and unlinkable privacy-preserving single sign-on system,
 which protects a user's login activities at different RPs against both curious IdP and collusive RPs.
To the best of our knowledge,
 UPPRESSO is the first approach that defends against both the privacy threats of IdP-based login tracing and RP-based identity linkage at the same time.
To achieve these goals, we convert the privacy dilemma in SSO services into an identity-transformation challenge
 and design three transformation functions based on elliptic curve cryptography,
 where $\mathcal{F}_{ID_{RP} \mapsto PID_{RP}}$ prevents curious IdP from knowing RP's identity,
 $\mathcal{F}_{ID_{U} \mapsto PID_{U}}$ prevents collusive RPs from linking a user based on her identifier,
 and $\mathcal{F}_{PID_{U} \mapsto Account}$ allows RP to derive an identical account for a user in her multiple logins.
The three functions could be integrated with existing SSO protocols,
    such as OIDC,
    to enhance the protection of user privacy,
    without breaking any security guarantees of existing SSO designs.
Moreover, the evaluation of the prototype of UPPRESSO demonstrates
 that it supports an efficient SSO service, where a single login takes only 310 ms on average.
