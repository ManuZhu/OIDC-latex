In this paper, we propose UPPRESSO, an unlinkable privacy-preserving single sign-on system, which protects a user's login activities at different RPs against both curious IdP and collusive RPs. To the best of our knowledge, UPPRESSO is the first approach that defend against both IdP-based login tracing and RP-based identity linkage privacy threats at the same time. To achieve these goals, we convert the privacy problem in SSO services into an identifier-transformation problem and design three transformation functions based on the discrete logarithm problem, where $\mathcal{F}_{ID_{RP} \mapsto PID_{RP}}$ prevents curious IdP from knowing the identity of the RP, $\mathcal{F}_{ID_{U} \mapsto PID_{U}}$ prevents collusive RPs from linking a user based on her identifier, and $\mathcal{F}_{PID_{U} \mapsto Account}$ allows each RP to derive an identical account for a user in her multiple logins. The three functions could be integrated with existing SSO protocols, such as OIDC, to enhance the protection of user privacy, without breaking any security guarantee of SSO. Moreover, the evaluation on the prototype of UPPRESSO demonstrates that it supports an efficient SSO service, where a single login takes only 492 ms on average.
