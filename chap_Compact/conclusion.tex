\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}
This paper proposes UPPRESSO, an untraceable and unlinkable privacy-preserving SSO system,
 to protect a user's online profile at different RPs against a curious IdP and colluding RPs.
We propose an identity-transformation approach for privacy-preserving SSO,
 and design algorithms satisfying the requirements,
 where (\emph{a}) $\mathcal{F}_{PID_{RP}}$ protects an RP's identity from the curious IdP,
(\emph{b})  $\mathcal{F}_{PID_{U}}$ prevents colluding RPs from linking a user across these RPs,
 and (\emph{c}) $\mathcal{F}_{Acct}$ enables the visited RP to derive an identical account for a user in his multiple logins.
These identity transformations are integrated with the widely-adopted OIDC protocol
    to protect user privacy and keep user convenience,
    without breaking the security guarantees of SSO services.
The experimental evaluations of the UPPRESSO prototype show
 that it provides efficient SSO services:
  on average a login instance takes 174 ms when the IdP, the visited RP and users are deployed in a virtual private cloud, or 421 ms when a user visits remotely.
