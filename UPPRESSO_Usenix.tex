\title{{UPPRESSO}: An Unlinkable Privacy-PREserving Single Sign-On System}
\maketitle
\begin{abstract}
As a widely adopted identity management and authentication mechanism in today's Internet, single sign-on (SSO)
%Single sign-on (SSO) services have been widely adopted in today's Internet to support identity management and authentication. SSO
allows a user to maintain only the credential for the identity provider (IdP), instead of one credential for each relying party (RP), which shifts the burden of user authentication from RPs to the IdP.
%After being authenticated by the identity provider (IdP), a user is allowed to log in to relying parties (RPs) by submitting an \emph{identity proof} (i.e., id token of OpenID Connect or SAML assertion).
However, SSO introduces new privacy leakage threats, since (\emph{a}) a curious IdP could track {\em all} the RPs a user has visited,
%a user's all visits to any RP
and (\emph{b}) collusive RPs could learn a user's online profile by linking her identifiers and activities across multiple RPs.
%However, the privacy leakage is an obstacle to the users' adoption of SSO,
% as the curious IdP may track at which RPs users log in,
%while collusive RPs could link the user from a common or related identifer(s) issued by the IdP.
Several privacy-preserving SSO solutions have been proposed to defend against either the curious IdP or collusive RPs, however, none of them can address both privacy leakage threats at the same time.
%Existing privacy-preserving SSO approaches protect the users' activity profiles against either the curious IdP or the collusive RPs, but never prevent both of these threats.

In this paper, we propose a privacy-preserving SSO system, called \emph{UPPRESSO}, to protect a user's login traces %at different RPs
against both the curious IdP and collusive RPs. We first formally analyze the privacy dilemma between SSO security requirements and the new privacy requirements, and convert the SSO privacy problem into an identifier-transformation problem. Then, we design a novel {\em transformed RP designation} scheme to transform the identifier of the RP, to which the user requests to log in, into a privacy-preserving pseudo-identifier ($PID_{RP}$) through the cooperation between the user and the RP. Our {\em trapdoor user identification} scheme allows the RP to obtain a trapdoor from the transformation process and use it to derive a unique account of the user at that RP from her privacy-preserving pseudo-identifier ($PID_U$) generated by the IdP.
The login process of UPPRESSO follows the service pattern of OpenID Connect (OIDC), a widely deployed SSO system, with minimum modifications. And the system is platform independent. 
%We provide the prototype based on the open source OIDC implementation whihc is platform independent.
Our analysis shows UPPRESSO provides a comprehensive privacy protection while achieving the same security guarantees of OIDC.

% An example of a floating figure using the graphicx package.
% Note that \label must occur AFTER (or within) \caption.
% For figures, \caption should occur after the \includegraphics.
% Note that IEEEtran v1.7 and later has special internal code that
% is designed to preserve the operation of \label within \caption
% even when the captionsoff option is in effect. However, because
% of issues like this, it may be the safest practice to put all your
% \label just after \caption rather than within \caption{}.
%
% Reminder: the "draftcls" or "draftclsnofoot", not "draft", class
% option should be used if it is desired that the figures are to be
% displayed while in draft mode.

%\begin{figure}[!t]
%\centering
%\includegraphics[width=2.5in]{myfigure}

% and a .pdf suffix will be assumed for pdflatex; or what has been declared
% via \DeclareGraphicsExtensions.

%\end{figure}

% Note that IEEE typically puts floats only at the top, even when this
% results in a large percentage of a column being occupied by floats.


% An example of a double column floating figure using two subfigures.
% (The subfig.sty package must be loaded for this to work.)
% The subfigure \label commands are set within each subfloat command, the
% \label for the overall figure must come after \caption.
% \hfil must be used as a separator to get equal spacing.
% The subfigure.sty package works much the same way, except \subfigure is
% used instead of \subfloat.

%\subfloat[Case II]{\includegraphics[width=2.5in]{subfigcase2}%
%\label{fig_second_case}}}
%\caption{Simulation results}
%\label{fig_sim}
%\end{figure*}
%
% Note that often IEEE papers with subfigures do not employ subfigure
% captions (using the optional argument to \subfloat), but instead will
% reference/describe all of them (a), (b), etc., within the main caption.


% An example of a floating table. Note that, for IEEE style tables, the 
% \caption command should come BEFORE the table. Table text will default to
% \footnotesize as IEEE normally uses this smaller font for tables.
% The \label must come after \caption as always.
%
%\begin{table}[!t]
%% increase table row spacing, adjust to taste
%\renewcommand{\arraystretch}{1.3}
% if using array.sty, it might be a good idea to tweak the value of
% \extrarowheight as needed to properly center the text within the cells
%\caption{An Example of a Table}
%\label{table_example}
%\centering
%% Some packages, such as MDW tools, offer better commands for making tables
%% than the plain LaTeX2e tabular which is used here.
%\begin{tabular}{|c||c|}
%\hline

%Three & Four\\
%\hline
%\end{tabular}
%\end{table}


% Note that IEEE does not put floats in the very first column - or typically
% anywhere on the first page for that matter. Also, in-text middle ("here")
% positioning is not used. Most IEEE journals/conferences use top floats
% exclusively. Note that, LaTeX2e, unlike IEEE journals/conferences, places
% footnotes above bottom floats. This can be corrected via the \fnbelowfloat
% command of the stfloats package.
