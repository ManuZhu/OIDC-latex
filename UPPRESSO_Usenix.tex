\title{UPPRESSO: Untraceable and Unlinkable Privacy-PREserving\\Single Sign-On Services}

\maketitle
\begin{abstract}
Single sign-on (SSO) allows a user to maintain only the credential at an identity provider (IdP), to login to numerous relying parties (RPs).
However, SSO introduces extra privacy threats, compared with traditional authentication mechanisms,
 as (\emph{a}) the curious IdP could track all RPs which a user is visiting,
 and (\emph{b}) colluding RPs could learn a user's online profile by linking his identities across these RPs.
This paper presents a privacy-preserving SSO system, called \emph{UPPRESSO},
 to protect a user's online profile against both a curious IdP and colluding RPs.
We %analyze the requirements of security and privacy, and
 propose an identity-transformation approach.
In each SSO login instance,
    an \emph{ephemeral pseudo-identity} of an RP (denoted as $PID_{RP}$),
        is negotiated between a user and the RP.
$PID_{RP}$ is sent to an IdP and designated in an identity token,
        so the IdP is not aware of the visited RP.
Then,
    $PID_{RP}$ is used by the IdP to transform the \emph{permanent user identity} $ID_U$
        into an \emph{ephemeral user pseudo-identity} (denoted as $PID_U$)
        in the identity token.
On receiving the identity token,
    the RP transforms $PID_U$ into a \emph{permanent account} of the user (denoted as $Acct$).
  %   by a trapdoor in the negotiation.
Given a user, the account at each RP is unique and different from $ID_U$,
    so colluding RPs cannot link his identities across RPs.
We build the prototype
    on top of MITREid Connect, an open-source SSO system.
The extensive evaluation shows that UPPRESSO
        fulfills the requirements of both security and privacy
        and introduces reasonable overheads.

% An example of a floating figure using the graphicx package.
% Note that \label must occur AFTER (or within) \caption.
% For figures, \caption should occur after the \includegraphics.
% Note that IEEEtran v1.7 and later has special internal code that
% is designed to preserve the operation of \label within \caption
% even when the captionsoff option is in effect. However, because
% of issues like this, it may be the safest practice to put all your
% \label just after \caption rather than within \caption{}.
%
% Reminder: the "draftcls" or "draftclsnofoot", not "draft", class
% option should be used if it is desired that the figures are to be
% displayed while in draft mode.

%\begin{figure}[!t]
%\centering
%\includegraphics[width=2.5in]{myfigure}
% where an .eps filename suffix will be assumed under latex,
% and a .pdf suffix will be assumed for pdflatex; or what has been declared
% via \DeclareGraphicsExtensions.
%\caption{Simulation Results}
%\label{fig_sim}
%\end{figure}

% Note that IEEE typically puts floats only at the top, even when this
% results in a large percentage of a column being occupied by floats.


% An example of a double column floating figure using two subfigures.
% (The subfig.sty package must be loaded for this to work.)
% The subfigure \label commands are set within each subfloat command, the
% \label for the overall figure must come after \caption.
% \hfil must be used as a separator to get equal spacing.
% The subfigure.sty package works much the same way, except \subfigure is
% used instead of \subfloat.

%\begin{figure*}[!t]
%\centerline{\subfloat[Case I]\includegraphics[width=2.5in]{subfigcase1}%
%\label{fig_first_case}}
%\hfil
%\subfloat[Case II]{\includegraphics[width=2.5in]{subfigcase2}%
%\label{fig_second_case}}}
%\caption{Simulation results}
%\label{fig_sim}
%\end{figure*}
%
% Note that often IEEE papers with subfigures do not employ subfigure
% captions (using the optional argument to \subfloat), but instead will
% reference/describe all of them (a), (b), etc., within the main caption.


% An example of a floating table. Note that, for IEEE style tables, the
% \caption command should come BEFORE the table. Table text will default to
% \footnotesize as IEEE normally uses this smaller font for tables.
% The \label must come after \caption as always.
%
%\begin{table}[!t]
%% increase table row spacing, adjust to taste
%\renewcommand{\arraystretch}{1.3}
% if using array.sty, it might be a good idea to tweak the value of
% \extrarowheight as needed to properly center the text within the cells
%\caption{An Example of a Table}
%\label{table_example}
%\centering
%% Some packages, such as MDW tools, offer better commands for making tables
%% than the plain LaTeX2e tabular which is used here.
%\begin{tabular}{|c||c|}
%\hline
%One & Two\\
%\hline
%Three & Four\\
%\hline
%\end{tabular}
%\end{table}


% Note that IEEE does not put floats in the very first column - or typically
% anywhere on the first page for that matter. Also, in-text middle ("here")
% positioning is not used. Most IEEE journals/conferences use top floats
% exclusively. Note that, LaTeX2e, unlike IEEE journals/conferences, places
% footnotes above bottom floats. This can be corrected via the \fnbelowfloat
% command of the stfloats package.
