\begin{abstract}
Single sign-on (SSO) allows a user to maintain only the credential at an identity provider (IdP) to login to multiple relying parties (RPs).
However, SSO introduces privacy threats,
    as ({\em a}) the curious IdP could potentially track a user's visits to all RPs,
    and ({\em b}) colluding RPs could learn a user's online profile by linking identities across these RPs.
This paper presents a privacy-preserving SSO system, called \emph{UPPRESSO}, to protect a user's online profile against a curious IdP and colluding RPs.
We propose an identity-transformation approach.
 In each SSO login instance,
    an \emph{ephemeral pseudo-identity} of an RP (denoted as $PID_{RP}$),
        is negotiated between a user and the RP.
$PID_{RP}$ is sent to the IdP and designated in the identity token, so that the IdP is not aware of the visited RP.
The IdP then uses $PID_{RP}$ to transform the user's permanent identity $ID_U$, into an ephemeral user pseudo-identity $PID_U$, in the token.
On receiving the identity token, %%%% the RP just waits for it.
    the RP transforms $PID_U$ into a \emph{permanent account} of the user, denoted as $Acct$.
Given a user, the account at each RP is unique and different from $ID_U$,
%%%% for different users, the accounts may be the same.
so colluding RPs cannot link a user's identities across RPs.
We have built a prototype system of UPPRESSO on top of MITREid Connect, an open-source SSO system.
The extensive evaluations show that UPPRESSO fulfills the security and privacy requirements of SSO
        %%%% I find that other big-4 conference papers just write "SSO", not SSOs.
 while introducing reasonable overheads.

% An example of a floating figure using the graphicx package.
% Note that \label must occur AFTER (or within) \caption.
% For figures, \caption should occur after the \includegraphics.
% Note that IEEEtran v1.7 and later has special internal code that
% is designed to preserve the operation of \label within \caption
% even when the captionsoff option is in effect. However, because
% of issues like this, it may be the safest practice to put all your
% \label just after \caption rather than within \caption{}.
%
% Reminder: the "draftcls" or "draftclsnofoot", not "draft", class
% option should be used if it is desired that the figures are to be
% displayed while in draft mode.

%\begin{figure}[!t]
%\centering
%\includegraphics[width=2.5in]{myfigure}
% where an .eps filename suffix will be assumed under latex,
% and a .pdf suffix will be assumed for pdflatex; or what has been declared
% via \DeclareGraphicsExtensions.
%\caption{Simulation Results}
%\label{fig_sim}
%\end{figure}

% Note that IEEE typically puts floats only at the top, even when this
% results in a large percentage of a column being occupied by floats.


% An example of a double column floating figure using two subfigures.
% (The subfig.sty package must be loaded for this to work.)
% The subfigure \label commands are set within each subfloat command, the
% \label for the overall figure must come after \caption.
% \hfil must be used as a separator to get equal spacing.
% The subfigure.sty package works much the same way, except \subfigure is
% used instead of \subfloat.
%
%\begin{figure*}[!t]
%\centerline{\subfloat[Case I]\includegraphics[width=2.5in]{subfigcase1}%
%\label{fig_first_case}}
%\hfil
%\subfloat[Case II]{\includegraphics[width=2.5in]{subfigcase2}%
%\label{fig_second_case}}}
%\caption{Simulation results}
%\label{fig_sim}
%\end{figure*}
%
% Note that often IEEE papers with subfigures do not employ subfigure
% captions (using the optional argument to \subfloat), but instead will
% reference/describe all of them (a), (b), etc., within the main caption.


% An example of a floating table. Note that, for IEEE style tables, the
% \caption command should come BEFORE the table. Table text will default to
% \footnotesize as IEEE normally uses this smaller font for tables.
% The \label must come after \caption as always.
%
%\begin{table}[!t]
%% increase table row spacing, adjust to taste
%\renewcommand{\arraystretch}{1.3}
% if using array.sty, it might be a good idea to tweak the value of
% \extrarowheight as needed to properly center the text within the cells
%\caption{An Example of a Table}
%\label{table_example}
%\centering
%% Some packages, such as MDW tools, offer better commands for making tables
%% than the plain LaTeX2e tabular which is used here.
%\begin{tabular}{|c||c|}
%\hline
%One & Two\\
%\hline
%Three & Four\\
%\hline
%\end{tabular}
%\end{table}


% Note that IEEE does not put floats in the very first column - or typically
% anywhere on the first page for that matter. Also, in-text middle ("here")
% positioning is not used. Most IEEE journals/conferences use top floats
% exclusively. Note that, LaTeX2e, unlike IEEE journals/conferences, places
% footnotes above bottom floats. This can be corrected via the \fnbelowfloat
% command of the stfloats package.
